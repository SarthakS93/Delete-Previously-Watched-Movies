Two and a Half Men S03E24 - That Pistol-Packin' Hermaphrodite - Web-DL [KoTuWa]

1
00:00:03,377 --> 00:00:05,296
Hello?

2
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,676
Anybody?

3
00:00:12,803 --> 00:00:14,805
Big news.

4
00:00:15,723 --> 00:00:17,808
I'm gonna marry Mia.

5
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:19,852
Hey, Alan.

6
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:21,854
I'm in the shower.

7
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:23,648
Guess what I'm gonna do
with Mia.

8
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,943
Guess what I'm already doing
with Kandi.

9
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:29,737
That's not fair, Alan.

10
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,447
You have to give him a hint.

11
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:33,449
He doesn't need a hint.

12
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,868
Well, then how's he supposed
to guess?

13
00:00:38,704 --> 00:00:39,956
Oh, well.

14
00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:45,586
Look, a place to hang my washcloth.

15
00:00:53,177 --> 00:00:55,262
The rule of thumb
with an engagement ring...

16
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:58,224
...is that the price should equal
three months' salary.

17
00:00:59,892 --> 00:01:01,852
I wonder what broad
came up with that.

18
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:07,066
It's a marketing scheme dreamed up
by the international diamond cartel.

19
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,026
Probably a bunch of chicks.

20
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,905
But at least diamonds are forever.

21
00:01:13,447 --> 00:01:16,325
Oh, yeah, forever.
My ex-wife still has hers.

22
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:20,287
Meanwhile, I'm wearing mismatched
socks from the irregular bin.

23
00:01:20,788 --> 00:01:22,790
Well, Mia and I are gonna go
the distance.

24
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,500
Fifteen, maybe 20 years.

25
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,460
That's not the distance.

26
00:01:26,627 --> 00:01:28,462
The distance is death.

27
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,632
If I'm still married
after 20 years, kill me.

28
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:36,012
- I can't believe you're doing this at all.
- Why not?

29
00:01:36,178 --> 00:01:39,306
Why shouldn't someone like me
settle down with a wife and kids?

30
00:01:39,473 --> 00:01:41,434
Boy, I don't know where to start.

31
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:43,936
That's the old Charlie
you're thinking of.

32
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:45,312
Oh, okay.

33
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,441
And to whom am I speaking now?

34
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:51,777
- May I help you gentlemen?
- We're looking for an engagement ring.

35
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:53,320
How nice.

36
00:01:54,905 --> 00:01:56,323
Do you have anything in mind?

37
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:01,579
Nothing ostentatious.

38
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:05,249
Something in a brilliant cut,
perhaps with complementary baguettes.

39
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,918
Size isn't as important
as color and clarity.

40
00:02:08,335 --> 00:02:10,337
Well, someone knows what he wants.

41
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,842
What can I say?

42
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,969
He's my life.

43
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:25,644
So basically I asked her to marry me
and she said yes.

44
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:32,234
- What do you think about that, Jake?
- Good.

45
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,320
That's it? Good?

46
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:35,946
It's not good?

47
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:37,448
No, it's good.

48
00:02:37,948 --> 00:02:39,408
That's what I said.

49
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,244
All right, I'm full.

50
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,124
Wears his little heart on his sleeve,
doesn't he?

51
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,667
It's my own fault.

52
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:52,546
I should've known better
than to talk to him at feeding time.

53
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,050
Charlie, I need to speak to you.

54
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:58,636
I'll be right out, Rose.

55
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:02,806
- Did you tell her?
- Of course not.

56
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:04,225
- Would you?
- No.

57
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:06,852
- I'll let you be my best man.
- You mean I'm not?

58
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,022
Well, you're on the short list
but this could cinch it.

59
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:13,400
Come on, that woman has been
obsessed with you for years.

60
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:16,529
She's gonna find out sooner or later.
Let it come from you.

61
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,365
Yeah, I guess.

62
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,867
She has a boyfriend now.
She probably won't care.

63
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:24,119
- Probably not.
- So why won't you tell her?

64
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:27,581
Because if I want my eyebrows shaved,
I'll shave them myself.

65
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,837
Hey, Rosey Rose.

66
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,048
What's up, Rosey Rose?

67
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,758
Gordon dumped me.

68
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,094
Oh, damn it to hell.

69
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,889
I know, it's awful.

70
00:03:44,306 --> 00:03:45,891
How could he do this?

71
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:49,603
He couldn't be with me anymore
knowing that I'm still in love with you.

72
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,773
Oh, no, no, no.

73
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,149
Yes, yes, yes...

74
00:03:54,316 --> 00:03:56,235
...yes, yes.

75
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,113
Listen, Rose.

76
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:02,408
- There's something I have to tell you.
- Ls it good news?

77
00:04:02,574 --> 00:04:03,951
I could use some good news.

78
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:07,413
Well...

79
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:11,458
- ...you remember Mia?
- Yeah.

80
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:14,336
Don't tell me you're dating her again.

81
00:04:14,503 --> 00:04:16,088
No, no. No, we are not dating.

82
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:19,174
Good. Because I always thought
she was kind of a head case.

83
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,554
Yeah.

84
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:28,851
Look, the thing is, I'm gonna,
kind of, marry her.

85
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:35,107
Rose?

86
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:38,777
- Did you hear me?
- I heard you.

87
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:40,237
You're gonna marry Mia.

88
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,490
So are you okay?

89
00:04:43,824 --> 00:04:44,950
Sure.

90
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:46,326
Why wouldn't I be okay?

91
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:51,290
Well, I was afraid the news might come
as a bit of a shock to you.

92
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:52,583
Afraid?

93
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,918
There's nothing to be afraid of, Charlie.

94
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:57,129
You're my friend.

95
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,509
Where are you going?

96
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:03,802
I have things to do.

97
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,764
- What kind of things?
- Things.

98
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:09,892
Goodbye, Charlie.

99
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:14,062
Hello, Alan.

100
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:15,939
Hello.

101
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,781
Did she just use the front door?

102
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:28,368
She's never used
the front door before.

103
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,498
What happened out there?

104
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:34,875
Well, I told her
I was gonna marry Mia...

105
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:39,213
...and I think I could actually see
her medication stop working.

106
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:47,137
- What do you think she's gonna do?
- The question isn't what, it's when.

107
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:53,143
And how I'm gonna enjoy my honeymoon
with my testicles glued to my ass-crack.

108
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:59,942
- That's a pretty wedding gown.
- Oh, yeah.

109
00:06:00,108 --> 00:06:02,444
I could crawl under there
during the reception...

110
00:06:02,611 --> 00:06:04,821
...and no one would have a clue.

111
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:07,866
Well, you would.

112
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,660
Stop.

113
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:12,287
I don't think you'd say that.

114
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:14,289
Isn't it beautiful?

115
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:17,918
They say you're supposed to spend
three months' salary but I went four.

116
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:21,255
- Because I'm worth it?
- No, actually I had a slow first quarter.

117
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,343
My dad called today. He wants to
take your family out for dinner.

118
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,264
Yeah, well, tell him he can have one
or the other but not both.

119
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:33,141
Come on, they're gonna have to
meet sooner or later.

120
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:36,395
Okay, but why don't we wait
for a real happy occasion?

121
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:41,191
- What's happier than a wedding?
- My mother's funeral springs to mind.

122
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:45,112
There'll be music, dancing,
my mom will be in a box.

123
00:06:46,154 --> 00:06:48,031
You're horrible.

124
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:49,700
That's a gorgeous wedding cake.

125
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:50,909
It's okay.

126
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:53,829
I'm not big on having
the little action figures on top.

127
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,331
- They kind of creep me out.
- They're traditional.

128
00:06:56,498 --> 00:06:59,334
Hey, this is our wedding,
we can do whatever we want.

129
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:02,963
We don't even have to have cake,
we could have pie.

130
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:05,674
A wedding pie?

131
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:08,176
Well, we'd probably need
more than one.

132
00:07:08,343 --> 00:07:10,679
You know, so everybody gets
some crust.

133
00:07:12,055 --> 00:07:15,267
Alan, what do you think
about a wedding with no cake?

134
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:18,186
No cake? Where would you put
the little bride and groom?

135
00:07:18,895 --> 00:07:20,939
I can think of one place.

136
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:25,694
- If you do a wedding, do it right.
- Thank you, Alan.

137
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:28,864
You're welcome. Which reminds me,
I found my wedding folder.

138
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:32,617
- Guess what was in it?
- The claim check for your manhood?

139
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,370
As I was saying...

140
00:07:35,537 --> 00:07:38,999
...it's all here. Everything you could
possibly need for your big day.

141
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,001
From paper samples
for your announcements...

142
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:44,337
...to selected verses of poetry
well-suited for wedding vows.

143
00:07:44,504 --> 00:07:47,716
And you wonder why people
think you're gay.

144
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,968
Oh, shush.

145
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:53,263
Now, you're talking cake
but we are light years away from cake.

146
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,850
First we have to discuss the budget,
the venue, how many guests.

147
00:07:57,017 --> 00:07:59,186
Is it gonna be a sit-down dinner
or a buffet.

148
00:07:59,352 --> 00:08:03,065
Then you need to hire a photographer
and a videographer. Then a florist.

149
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:04,775
Have you thought about flowers?

150
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:06,902
Well, lilies are nice.

151
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,280
Lilies are perfect if the bride and groom
are recently deceased.

152
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:15,869
But I like lilies.

153
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:19,331
Mia, we'll never get through this
if you don't focus.

154
00:08:19,623 --> 00:08:21,625
Now, wedding party.

155
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,710
Bridesmaids. What are they wearing?

156
00:08:23,877 --> 00:08:26,505
I suggest an unflattering style
in a hideous color...

157
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:29,674
...because after all, this is your day.

158
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:33,678
Oh, and before I forget, although
it's not politically correct to throw rice...

159
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:37,641
...if you throw birdseed, you run the risk
of ending like a Hitchcock movie.

160
00:08:41,102 --> 00:08:43,063
What kind of pie
did you have in mind?

161
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:47,234
Well, look who's here.
The bride of Drunkenstein.

162
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:48,485
Look.

163
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:51,279
Wow, that's quite a rock.

164
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:55,826
You know what we call babes
with rings like that in my neighborhood?

165
00:08:55,992 --> 00:08:57,911
Stumpy.

166
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:03,333
What are you looking at me for?
Just stay out of her neighborhood.

167
00:09:07,587 --> 00:09:09,840
That was uncomfortable.

168
00:09:10,006 --> 00:09:13,510
No, sand in my urethra
is uncomfortable.

169
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:16,638
That meal was a freaking disaster.

170
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:21,893
I'm gonna stay with my family,
try and calm my mother down.

171
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:24,563
The miserable bitch.

172
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:28,400
- Your family hates me, don't they?
- Not just you.

173
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:31,194
I'll call you later.

174
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:37,200
Do you believe your
future mother-in-law?

175
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:40,161
Shows up at a four-star restaurant
wearing a tracksuit...

176
00:09:40,328 --> 00:09:44,249
...with the word "juicy" stretched across
her half-acre ass.

177
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,626
I can read, Mom.

178
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,462
Can we go back?
I forgot my doggy bag.

179
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:52,090
We can never go back, Jake.

180
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:54,551
Come on, it's not the end
of the world.

181
00:09:54,718 --> 00:09:58,221
Easy for you to say. You're not marrying
into the Addams family.

182
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,182
Oh, like you were a prize.

183
00:10:01,349 --> 00:10:04,769
Slipping a prenuptial agreement
into my fiancée's menu.

184
00:10:05,228 --> 00:10:07,314
I am just trying to protect you...

185
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,858
...from being wiped out
by a vindictive ex-wife...

186
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:14,738
...who will use your hard-earned money
to finance a frivolous life of partying...

187
00:10:14,904 --> 00:10:17,615
...and shopping
and unnecessary plastic surgery.

188
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:20,785
- Mom...
- Every one of my surgeries...

189
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:22,954
...was necessary.

190
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:24,914
And if I had signed a pre-nup...

191
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:27,292
...you would never have gone
to music camp...

192
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:31,171
...and Alan would have an overbite
you could use to open a can of Pennzoil.

193
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:36,134
I didn't know Mia's last name
was Addams.

194
00:10:36,634 --> 00:10:38,678
I didn't know her sister is a cop.

195
00:10:38,845 --> 00:10:40,221
Was a cop.

196
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:44,059
Now she's a dry drunk
with a grudge and a.38.

197
00:10:45,643 --> 00:10:47,562
Well, I liked her.

198
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:51,316
Well, that's because she had
the same haircut as you.

199
00:10:51,524 --> 00:10:54,736
I was a little shocked that her father
stuck you with the bill.

200
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:56,363
You know why you noticed that?

201
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:58,698
Because the two of you
trampled each other...

202
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:02,285
...trying to get to the men's room
when you saw the waiter bringing it.

203
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:05,705
I drank a lot of iced tea.

204
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,750
Well, I had a very nice time.

205
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,128
Sure, you got to inform my bride-to-be
and her entire family...

206
00:11:12,295 --> 00:11:15,215
...that you had sex with me
before you had sex with him.

207
00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:18,885
I was just telling Mia
I know how lucky she is.

208
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:21,679
Nevertheless, honey,
it was not an appropriate toast.

209
00:11:23,765 --> 00:11:27,060
Juicy-pants almost choked to death
on her lamb shank.

210
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,148
Well, in all fairness, the woman was
stuffing her face like a musket.

211
00:11:32,482 --> 00:11:34,526
All I can say is,
after tonight's fiasco...

212
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:37,904
...I'm gonna have to rethink
the seating chart for the wedding.

213
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:40,031
Yeah, well, it won't be
that complicated.

214
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:43,493
- Why not?
- Because none of you are invited.

215
00:11:45,954 --> 00:11:49,624
Well, Mom, if you wear an animal print
tracksuit to a nice restaurant...

216
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,918
...people are gonna make comments.

217
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:53,378
I agree.

218
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:56,923
Calling you a cougar with arm fat
was over the line.

219
00:11:57,507 --> 00:11:59,175
Hang on.

220
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:06,224
Hello, Mia.

221
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:08,309
I'll call you back.

222
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:21,406
You don't think Mia's gonna turn
into her mother, do you?

223
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:23,408
I wouldn't worry about it.

224
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:24,617
Yeah.

225
00:12:24,784 --> 00:12:28,413
What I would worry about
is you turning her into our mother.

226
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:32,500
Thanks for ruining my wedding night,
Dr. Freud.

227
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:35,253
Hey, don't set the bar too high
for the wedding night.

228
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,089
- What are you talking about?
- It's a long, stressful day.

229
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:42,427
You'll be exhausted, full of banquet food
and cheap champagne.

230
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:43,678
Take my advice.

231
00:12:43,845 --> 00:12:46,180
Tell her you love her,
give her a big kiss...

232
00:12:46,347 --> 00:12:49,851
...and try to fall asleep with your ass
pointed toward an open window.

233
00:12:55,481 --> 00:12:57,775
You, sir, have the heart of a poet.

234
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:05,033
I am merely the voice
of smelly experience.

235
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:10,622
Well then, let me ask you this.

236
00:13:10,788 --> 00:13:13,291
I know things didn't end well
with you and Judith...

237
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,169
...but overall,
did you like being married?

238
00:13:16,336 --> 00:13:17,670
Oh, I loved being married.

239
00:13:17,837 --> 00:13:19,881
Never missed having sex
with other women?

240
00:13:20,048 --> 00:13:22,884
Sure. But I missed that
before I got married too.

241
00:13:24,427 --> 00:13:28,431
What I loved was the idea of having
someone that I could always turn to.

242
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:30,308
Someone who cared about me.

243
00:13:30,475 --> 00:13:33,644
Someone who'd always stand by me
through thick and thin.

244
00:13:33,811 --> 00:13:34,854
It does sound nice.

245
00:13:35,521 --> 00:13:38,858
Yeah, so does Disneyland.

246
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:43,738
Yet every day people stagger off
those giant teacups covered in vomit.

247
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:48,659
But you'd do it again?

248
00:13:48,868 --> 00:13:50,119
What can I say?

249
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:51,829
Marriage is a great ride...

250
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:53,039
...until you puke.

251
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:59,670
- Good night.
- Good night.

252
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:06,844
Charlie.

253
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:08,596
Mia?

254
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:13,810
Your friend Rose
was just at my apartment.

255
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:19,023
So how'd that go?

256
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,318
She was wearing a bridal gown.
Planning on wearing it to our wedding.

257
00:14:22,485 --> 00:14:24,821
She wanted me to know
so we wouldn't clash.

258
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,573
Well, that's kind of thoughtful, isn't it?

259
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,743
I'm not finished.
She wanted to give me a shower.

260
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,495
An engagement shower?

261
00:14:32,662 --> 00:14:35,039
An actual soap and water shower.

262
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,835
I don't want her at my wedding.

263
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:41,212
Hey, I don't want her in my zip code.

264
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:43,047
But she's a close friend.

265
00:14:43,506 --> 00:14:46,968
- Charlie.
- All right, all right, I'll tell you what...

266
00:14:47,885 --> 00:14:49,846
...I'll cross Rose off the guest list...

267
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:53,683
...if you dump that pistol-packing
hermaphrodite you call a sister.

268
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:55,601
She's my maid of honor...

269
00:14:55,768 --> 00:14:59,063
...the gun is registered,
and she's taking hormones.

270
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:02,233
While we're pruning,
what about your mother?

271
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,360
Done. She's out. Now your mother.

272
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:07,238
You would've thrown your mother
overboard for free.

273
00:15:07,738 --> 00:15:09,073
I don't care. If she goes...

274
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,118
...somebody on your side's gotta go.
How about your father?

275
00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:16,581
He takes us all out to dinner and the only
plastic he's got on him is his shoes.

276
00:15:17,123 --> 00:15:19,375
Charlie, he has to give me away
at the wedding.

277
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:21,711
Give you away? That cheapskate?

278
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:25,339
I'll probably have to trade him a pony
and a couple of blankets for you.

279
00:15:26,048 --> 00:15:30,136
We're gonna have a wedding that none
of our family and friends can attend?

280
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,014
Might as well go to Vegas and elope.

281
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:40,271
Now, there's an interesting concept.

282
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:43,065
In Vegas, not only
could we get married immediately...

283
00:15:43,232 --> 00:15:46,068
...we can get drunk
and gamble away our nest egg.

284
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:48,613
Don't forget the lap dances
and hookers.

285
00:15:49,113 --> 00:15:51,991
Oh, you're gonna make a great wife.

286
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:04,837
All the wonderful plans
I had for a wedding.

287
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,548
Let it go, Alan.

288
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:09,800
I don't understand the big rush.

289
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:12,011
You wouldn't even stop
for boutonnieres.

290
00:16:13,512 --> 00:16:15,598
I just wanna get this over with.

291
00:16:15,765 --> 00:16:16,891
Get this over with?

292
00:16:17,058 --> 00:16:20,603
That's the attitude you take
to a proctologist, not a marriage.

293
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:22,813
Well, maybe I'm a little nervous.

294
00:16:23,022 --> 00:16:24,982
- Is that all it is?
- What are you saying?

295
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:29,070
I'm saying that if you're feeling uneasy,
maybe you're not ready for this.

296
00:16:29,236 --> 00:16:31,656
- Did you have doubts when you married?
- None.

297
00:16:31,822 --> 00:16:33,991
Judith assured me
I was doing the right thing.

298
00:16:46,587 --> 00:16:48,464
That's all I got.

299
00:16:51,842 --> 00:16:52,885
Hi.

300
00:16:55,304 --> 00:16:58,099
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks.

301
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:00,726
I was afraid you were gonna
chicken out.

302
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,146
That's funny, she said the same thing
about you.

303
00:17:05,272 --> 00:17:06,315
Thank you, Kandi.

304
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:09,902
Are you sure this is
what you wanna do?

305
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,029
I'm sure. Are you?

306
00:17:12,446 --> 00:17:14,365
Absolutely.

307
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:17,993
Okay. Who's the lucky couple?

308
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,749
Well, we're the ones getting married,
so I guess it's them.

309
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:27,420
- Charlie.
- A joke.

310
00:17:27,586 --> 00:17:30,089
Alrighty. Now, before we begin
the ceremony...

311
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:33,217
...I need both your signatures
there and there.

312
00:17:33,426 --> 00:17:35,094
Okay.

313
00:17:35,261 --> 00:17:39,515
So are you folks staying in Vegas or are
you honeymooning somewhere else?

314
00:17:39,682 --> 00:17:41,851
I don't know.
What do you think, sweetie?

315
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:44,395
Oh, can I talk to you for a second?

316
00:17:45,646 --> 00:17:47,439
What'd I say?
Am I in trouble already?

317
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:52,820
Baby, I swear to God,
I think we're the lucky couple.

318
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,906
Relax, I just want to talk to you
about our honeymoon.

319
00:17:57,408 --> 00:17:59,201
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go.

320
00:17:59,368 --> 00:18:01,662
Frankly, I'd pick a place
with a nice ceiling...

321
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:04,331
...because we're just gonna take turns
looking at it.

322
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,752
Charlie, I would love to honeymoon
with you.

323
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:10,671
But, well, I have to work...

324
00:18:10,838 --> 00:18:14,049
...and I think it'd be smarter
to use the money to redo the house.

325
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:17,219
Oh, I get it.
You gave up trying to change me...

326
00:18:17,386 --> 00:18:19,430
...so now the house has to suffer?

327
00:18:19,763 --> 00:18:22,766
If we're gonna have a family,
we'll turn the second bedroom...

328
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:26,061
- ...into a nursery.
- But that's where Jake stays.

329
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,521
But once Alan moves out...

330
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:30,149
...then Jake won't be staying there
anymore, right?

331
00:18:30,316 --> 00:18:33,402
- Alan's moving out?
- Of course he is.

332
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:35,112
Isn't he?

333
00:18:36,697 --> 00:18:39,283
This is so romantic.

334
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,077
When I was a little girl,
I used to love playing bride.

335
00:18:42,244 --> 00:18:43,746
Me too.

336
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:47,708
I mean, I was the groom.

337
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,919
Most of the time.

338
00:18:50,502 --> 00:18:52,379
You think you'll ever
get married again?

339
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:54,882
I don't know. I hope so.

340
00:18:55,341 --> 00:18:57,593
You should because you'd make
a good husband.

341
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,182
You're kind, considerate, dependable and
you're cuter than a duck wearing a hat.

342
00:19:05,768 --> 00:19:08,646
Oh, come on, Charlie,
we need our privacy.

343
00:19:08,812 --> 00:19:11,190
But they're my family.
I can't just kick them out.

344
00:19:11,398 --> 00:19:13,317
You could've said something
before now.

345
00:19:13,484 --> 00:19:17,988
Who knew your idea of marriage
was you and me alone in a house?

346
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:22,701
As long as I've known you, you've been
complaining about Alan living with you.

347
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:25,037
And you want to take that
away from me?

348
00:19:25,204 --> 00:19:28,499
I thought you were ready to grow up
but clearly I was wrong.

349
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:32,169
What's more grown up than wanting
to take care of my family?

350
00:19:32,336 --> 00:19:34,880
Let's not forget, you're the one
who came back to me.

351
00:19:35,047 --> 00:19:37,216
I only came back
because I wanted your sperm.

352
00:19:37,383 --> 00:19:39,343
Yeah, well, it's a package deal.

353
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,013
My sperm and my brother
go hand in hand.

354
00:19:46,475 --> 00:19:48,936
Kandi, this is so sudden.

355
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:51,855
I know. But lots of good things
are sudden.

356
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:55,192
Like sun showers, orgasms.

357
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:57,027
That's two things.

358
00:19:57,569 --> 00:19:59,154
Multiple orgasms.

359
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:02,908
That's five.

360
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,121
All right, deal's off.
Let's get out of here.

361
00:20:07,287 --> 00:20:09,748
Hang on. Are you really serious
about this?

362
00:20:09,915 --> 00:20:12,835
You love me, I love you,
the sex is great.

363
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:15,003
The sex is unbelievable.

364
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,131
Wait, what'd you say?

365
00:20:17,506 --> 00:20:19,591
I said the wedding's off.

366
00:20:19,758 --> 00:20:21,135
Oh, my God, what happened?

367
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:23,387
It doesn't matter.

368
00:20:23,554 --> 00:20:26,306
What's important is I just avoided
making a huge mistake.

369
00:20:26,473 --> 00:20:27,766
Charlie, I am so sorry.

370
00:20:27,975 --> 00:20:29,059
Oh, thanks.

371
00:20:29,226 --> 00:20:32,855
Now let's head for a strip joint,
get drunk and let the healing begin.

372
00:20:33,021 --> 00:20:35,399
Yeah, but before we do that,
I was wondering...

373
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:38,110
- ...could I ask you for a little favor.
- Yeah?

374
00:20:38,277 --> 00:20:40,654
- Can I borrow your wedding ring?
- What for?

375
00:20:41,363 --> 00:20:45,701
Well, I thought as long
as we're in Vegas, I'd marry Kandi.

376
00:20:48,912 --> 00:20:51,165
Are you insane?

377
00:20:51,331 --> 00:20:53,167
Oh, come on, you're not using it.

378
00:20:58,213 --> 00:21:01,258
By the powers vested in me
by the state of Nevada...

379
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:04,595
...I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

380
00:21:07,806 --> 00:21:10,642
I don't freaking believe it.

381
00:21:12,644 --> 00:21:15,772
Cheer up, Charlie. You're finally getting
what you always wanted.

382
00:21:15,939 --> 00:21:18,483
I'm moving out of your house.

383
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:23,488
I don't freaking believe it.

384
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,684
