Two and a Half Men S03E14 - Love Isn't Blind, It's Retarded - Web-DL [KoTuWa]

1
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:13,804
This is such a beautiful sunset.

2
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,765
Thanks.

3
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:19,894
Thanks? You're taking credit
for the sunset?

4
00:00:20,436 --> 00:00:22,355
No, not... Not the sunset per Se.

5
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:24,315
But I did buy a house on the beach...

6
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,859
...so we can stand here
and watch the sunset...

7
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:29,987
...so thanks.

8
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:32,823
Your house works with
a lot of women, doesn't it?

9
00:00:33,407 --> 00:00:37,912
Honestly, it's like a G-spot
with two mortgages.

10
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:41,749
Just so you know, I'm not with you
for your house or your money.

11
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,001
So it's the car.

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,753
Why would I care about your car?

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,047
It's an $80,000 Mercedes.

14
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,591
Yeah, so? What does it do
that other cars don't do?

15
00:00:50,758 --> 00:00:52,343
It costs $80,000.

16
00:00:53,844 --> 00:00:56,931
Hey, I almost forgot.
I have something for you.

17
00:00:57,139 --> 00:00:59,767
Charlie, you don't have
to buy me expensive jewelry.

18
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:03,229
Okay, nothing but cheap crap
from now on.

19
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:07,066
It's beautiful.

20
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,068
Read the inscription.

21
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:13,781
"One month, two weeks, four days."
What does it mean?

22
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:19,996
Well, since we decided to go ahead and
consummate our relationship finally...

23
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:23,708
...I thought I should honor the time
we've already spent together.

24
00:01:23,874 --> 00:01:26,002
Exclusively.
In a committed relationship.

25
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:31,090
Without any sex whatsoever.

26
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:34,051
So unless we have sex
before midnight...

27
00:01:34,218 --> 00:01:36,887
...you're gonna need to buy
a new bracelet?

28
00:01:37,304 --> 00:01:38,931
You're pretty sure of yourself.

29
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:44,186
Well, since you went to all the trouble
to engrave it...

30
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:47,148
Don't even ask what I used
as a chisel.

31
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,946
- Kandi.
- Hello, Alan.

32
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:57,199
Is Charlie available?
Because I wish to speak with him.

33
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:02,329
Okay, why don't you just wait here...

34
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:03,664
...and I'll let him know.

35
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:06,709
I would be immensely appreciative
if you would.

36
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:09,253
Alrighty.

37
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:53,172
What the hell does... this mean?

38
00:02:53,714 --> 00:02:55,424
- I was sending you a message.
- What?

39
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:57,676
That you're a woman trapped
in a man's body?

40
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,722
- Kandi's here.
- And you want me to call you Kandi?

41
00:03:02,264 --> 00:03:04,517
No, Kandi, the girl you were seeing
before Mia.

42
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:08,771
She's been calling here for days.

43
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,482
It's time you let her know
you're with another woman.

44
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,737
Yeah, Charlie, after all it's been
"one month, two weeks, four days."

45
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:22,660
Did you know that Alan's
a woman trapped in a man's body?

46
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,045
So you gonna go talk
to your ex-girlfriend?

47
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:36,047
Okay, first of all, sweetheart...

48
00:03:36,214 --> 00:03:38,175
...she's not really an ex-girlfriend.

49
00:03:38,341 --> 00:03:40,343
Her name's Kandi.

50
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:42,554
Thanks, Alan.

51
00:03:43,513 --> 00:03:44,806
With a K.

52
00:03:45,432 --> 00:03:48,101
- Alan.
- And an l.

53
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:53,106
So if Kandi with a K and an I
isn't your ex-girlfriend, then what is she?

54
00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:57,110
Well, l... I... I would say
she's more of a person...

55
00:03:57,277 --> 00:04:01,740
...who would drop by
from time to time and...

56
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:04,034
Yeah, that.

57
00:04:05,368 --> 00:04:08,413
Why haven't you told this person
that you're in a relationship?

58
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:10,499
Her name's Kandi.

59
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,876
Boy, you're on thin ice.

60
00:04:14,294 --> 00:04:16,630
I think we both know
why you didn't tell her.

61
00:04:16,796 --> 00:04:19,633
Well, if that's the case,
then this discussion is moot.

62
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:22,385
We should go upstairs
while Alan goes back...

63
00:04:22,552 --> 00:04:24,346
...and lies about my whereabouts.

64
00:04:24,554 --> 00:04:29,100
Well, I'm not half the liar you are,
but I'll give it a shot.

65
00:04:30,018 --> 00:04:32,646
Shall we go upstairs
and continue this conversation?

66
00:04:32,854 --> 00:04:34,689
Are you out of your freaking mind?

67
00:04:35,857 --> 00:04:38,610
Okay, you're mad, I get that.

68
00:04:39,152 --> 00:04:43,865
- So?
- Well, Kandi, it's like this.

69
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:47,577
Charlie's with another woman.

70
00:04:48,411 --> 00:04:50,872
Don't lie to me, Alan.

71
00:04:52,207 --> 00:04:53,667
Okay.

72
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,544
He's in Africa...

73
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,755
...working as a scrub nurse
for Doctors Without Borders.

74
00:04:59,464 --> 00:05:02,342
Story of my life.

75
00:05:02,884 --> 00:05:04,469
That's the story of your life?

76
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:06,638
It's not always a scrub nurse...

77
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:09,140
...but it's always Africa.

78
00:05:11,142 --> 00:05:13,311
Before you say anything,
I want you to know...

79
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:17,649
...I've anticipated problems like this.
Look on the other side of the bracelet.

80
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,194
"I'm very, very sorry."

81
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:29,869
Problem is, Charlie, that you don't
believe in this relationship.

82
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:31,663
Not believe in it?

83
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,708
It's kept me from having sex
for over six weeks.

84
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,877
It would be like not believing
in a serious groin pull.

85
00:05:38,086 --> 00:05:41,381
- You know what Kandi is?
- I try not to judge.

86
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:45,302
She's a lifeboat. You're keeping
a lifeboat for when this ship sinks.

87
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,846
Hey, hey, hey, lifeboats
don't mean you expect...

88
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:52,225
...the ship to sink.
The relationship, if I may.

89
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:55,520
What they mean is that you have
a healthy respect...

90
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:58,648
...for the power of the sea.

91
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,109
Are you listening to yourself?

92
00:06:01,943 --> 00:06:05,613
Yeah, I just caught the last part.
Not well thought out. No.

93
00:06:06,114 --> 00:06:11,119
All my life guys have looked at me
like I'm just some kind of sex toy.

94
00:06:11,911 --> 00:06:13,747
Well, they're wrong.

95
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,499
Yeah, just because you're good
at something...

96
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,210
...doesn't mean you
should be pigeonholed.

97
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:29,387
And the only reason
I'm so good at it...

98
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:31,890
...is because I practice.

99
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:37,270
Of course,
all the practice in the world...

100
00:06:37,437 --> 00:06:40,648
...isn't gonna help if you don't
love what you're doing.

101
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:46,446
What do you want me to do, Mia?

102
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:48,072
Call every woman I've known...

103
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:50,241
...to announce I'm now
in a relationship?

104
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,535
Hi, Shirley, this is Charlie Harper.

105
00:06:52,702 --> 00:06:56,206
We met at Disneyland
about 22 years ago.

106
00:06:56,623 --> 00:06:59,626
Yeah, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.
That was me.

107
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:03,630
Anyway, I thought you should know
I have a girlfriend now.

108
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:08,176
So I'd appreciate it if you
didn't call me. Okay, bye-bye.

109
00:07:09,052 --> 00:07:11,888
Well, that takes care of Shirley.
Now, what about Kandi?

110
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:14,682
You want me to tell her?
Fine. I'll tell her.

111
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:17,310
I'll go tell her right now.

112
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:21,731
But before I cut
her loose completely...

113
00:07:21,898 --> 00:07:23,775
...let me float a crazy idea by you.

114
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,697
Sort of a win, win, win.

115
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,242
Are you out of your freaking mind?

116
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:35,411
It was worth a shot.

117
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,750
Kandi, before you say anything,
I want you to know...

118
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:45,046
...I'm in a committed relationship now
and I'm really in love with this woman.

119
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:47,340
She's the best thing
that's happened to me...

120
00:07:47,549 --> 00:07:49,968
...and I can't imagine
being with anyone else.

121
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:52,720
Now, sweetheart.

122
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:57,559
Don't cry.
I'm sure you'll find someone else.

123
00:08:00,395 --> 00:08:02,564
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

124
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,149
What?
I thought we were going upstairs.

125
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:08,653
Okay, you're still mad. I get that.

126
00:08:14,284 --> 00:08:16,869
- I made your bed.
- Thank you.

127
00:08:17,078 --> 00:08:18,746
It's been real easy lately.

128
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:21,541
How nice for you.

129
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:24,294
You haven't even been flying solo,
have you?

130
00:08:25,044 --> 00:08:26,379
That's a little personal.

131
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:29,382
Hey, you want privacy,
wash your own sheets.

132
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,760
Once I get my mitts on them,
they're in the public domain.

133
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:34,595
- Good morning.
- Morning.

134
00:08:34,762 --> 00:08:38,141
- How did it go with Mia last night?
- Based on his laundry, not well.

135
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:42,270
- Why don't you tell the neighbors?
- Where do you think I'm going?

136
00:08:44,439 --> 00:08:46,858
By the way,
thanks for getting rid of Kandi for me.

137
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:48,860
Hey, I'm your brother.
I got your back.

138
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:50,486
Good to know.

139
00:08:50,653 --> 00:08:53,614
Hey, as long as we're on the subject,
I was wondering.

140
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:57,285
Since you're swimming in
Lake Monogamy, as it were...

141
00:08:58,453 --> 00:09:01,622
...would you mind if I, you know...

142
00:09:01,789 --> 00:09:04,042
- ...asked Kandi out sometime?
- Go for it.

143
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,627
- Just wanted to make sure you're okay.
- I'm fine.

144
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,131
- Don't want you to feel weird.
- Thanks for your consideration.

145
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,217
Morning, Huggy Bear.

146
00:09:19,932 --> 00:09:21,559
So, Kandi, wanna go out sometime?

147
00:09:31,486 --> 00:09:33,780
Okay, I want you to know
I tracked down Kandi.

148
00:09:33,988 --> 00:09:35,698
I told her to move on and she has.

149
00:09:35,865 --> 00:09:38,618
So I got no lifeboats,
no life preservers, no water wings.

150
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:41,245
If the ship goes down,
I'm going down with it.

151
00:09:41,454 --> 00:09:45,291
So there's no longer any reason to
put off you and me getting naked.

152
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,169
Charlie, I'd like you
to meet my parents.

153
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:53,966
Hello.

154
00:10:01,465 --> 00:10:03,467
What if Dad says I could stay up
to watch it?

155
00:10:03,634 --> 00:10:05,219
He won't.

156
00:10:05,428 --> 00:10:06,554
How do you know?

157
00:10:06,762 --> 00:10:10,057
Your father and I talk, so don't
try to play us against each other.

158
00:10:10,266 --> 00:10:12,852
I gotta try, it's what I do.

159
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,147
Hi.

160
00:10:17,523 --> 00:10:19,984
Hello. Is Alan here?

161
00:10:20,526 --> 00:10:22,737
Father Huggy Bear.

162
00:10:23,612 --> 00:10:25,489
Yes, my child?

163
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:29,493
- You've got company.
- Alan?

164
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:34,165
- Stall them, stall them, stall them.
- Okay.

165
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,084
You must be Jake.

166
00:10:38,127 --> 00:10:39,962
And you must be Jake's grandma.

167
00:10:46,052 --> 00:10:47,928
Judith, hi.

168
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:50,347
Go watch some cartoons.

169
00:10:50,556 --> 00:10:52,767
- Okay.
- Cool.

170
00:10:56,896 --> 00:10:59,315
- Are you proud of yourself?
- What do you mean?

171
00:10:59,523 --> 00:11:01,400
Oh, please,
she has to be half your age.

172
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:02,902
Oh, that.

173
00:11:03,068 --> 00:11:04,987
Yeah, I am pretty proud of that.

174
00:11:05,905 --> 00:11:07,740
What could you possibly
have in common?

175
00:11:07,907 --> 00:11:10,826
- What do you talk about?
- Talk?

176
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:14,455
To tell you the truth, we haven't
really done a lot of talking.

177
00:11:14,622 --> 00:11:17,666
I mean, I did hear her confession.

178
00:11:19,335 --> 00:11:22,004
She's been a very bad girl.

179
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:27,468
I'm supposed to leave Jake here?

180
00:11:27,635 --> 00:11:29,678
What kind of message does
that send him?

181
00:11:29,845 --> 00:11:31,555
I don't know.
Dreams can come true.

182
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:34,350
Life is beautiful. There is a God.

183
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:37,603
Hey, Judith. Father.

184
00:11:38,437 --> 00:11:41,774
I suppose you're the one that
introduced Alan to that slutty little...

185
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:44,860
Don't say it, Judith.
You'll just be demeaning all women.

186
00:11:45,027 --> 00:11:46,612
And yes.

187
00:11:47,196 --> 00:11:49,573
Figures. Well, I don't want
her around my son.

188
00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:53,244
Oh, really? So do I get to screen
the men that you're dating?

189
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,580
Let's not forget about the guy
who delivered the truckload of sod.

190
00:11:56,789 --> 00:11:59,250
- What about him?
- Lt doesn't take two months...

191
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,085
...to put down a new lawn, Judith.

192
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:05,631
Sounds like she got laid
before the sod did.

193
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,009
I'm not gonna dignify that
with a response.

194
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:13,347
Watch out for crab grass.

195
00:12:17,017 --> 00:12:19,687
So, what's Kandi, a nun?

196
00:12:19,895 --> 00:12:21,313
Catholic school girl.

197
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,607
Oh, excellent choice.

198
00:12:24,483 --> 00:12:26,735
Oh, hey, how...?
How are things with Mia?

199
00:12:26,944 --> 00:12:29,863
Not bad. She forgives me.
Introduced me to her parents.

200
00:12:30,072 --> 00:12:31,991
Oh, yeah? How did that go?

201
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,494
Well, you know,
those things are always awkward.

202
00:12:36,495 --> 00:12:39,456
The big news is I'm taking Mia
to the Bel Air Hotel tonight...

203
00:12:39,623 --> 00:12:42,835
...where we will express our love
in the way that we were meant to.

204
00:12:43,002 --> 00:12:44,795
- Drunk and in a hurry?
- You got it.

205
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:51,468
- How's the caviar?
- It's perfect.

206
00:12:51,677 --> 00:12:53,137
Everything's perfect.

207
00:12:53,846 --> 00:12:56,181
- Would you like a fire?
- Don't go to any trouble.

208
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,474
It's no trouble.

209
00:13:02,104 --> 00:13:04,815
Luckily I was a Boy Scout
in Beverly Hills.

210
00:13:05,024 --> 00:13:06,650
- Champagne?
- No, thanks.

211
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:09,987
I wanna be completely present
for the first time we make love.

212
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:11,822
Good for you.

213
00:13:12,948 --> 00:13:14,867
Don't you want to be present?

214
00:13:15,242 --> 00:13:17,119
Well, within reason.

215
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:19,788
Come on.

216
00:13:20,706 --> 00:13:23,459
What do you say
we save the champagne?

217
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,377
But I already opened it.

218
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:27,421
Do you need alcohol
to make love to me?

219
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:29,256
No, no.

220
00:13:29,423 --> 00:13:31,342
I don't need it.

221
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,427
Well, then.

222
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,267
Is something wrong?

223
00:13:40,434 --> 00:13:41,894
I don't know.

224
00:13:42,061 --> 00:13:44,980
I mean, we didn't hop into bed
on the first date.

225
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:47,941
We've gotten to know each other.
We're not drinking.

226
00:13:48,108 --> 00:13:50,027
It's all so new to me.

227
00:13:50,652 --> 00:13:52,404
That's what makes it special.

228
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:55,449
I just don't want either of us
to be disappointed...

229
00:13:55,616 --> 00:13:58,827
...because one of us might not be...

230
00:13:58,994 --> 00:14:00,579
...throwing their A-game tonight.

231
00:14:00,788 --> 00:14:03,624
- Are you nervous?
- No, no. Of course not.

232
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:08,212
But, you know, of the two of us,
only one can fake an A-game.

233
00:14:08,796 --> 00:14:11,507
There's nothing that you could do
to disappoint me tonight.

234
00:14:11,673 --> 00:14:14,968
No, no, it's what I can't do
that might disappoint you.

235
00:14:15,177 --> 00:14:17,304
You just relax. I'll be right back.

236
00:14:18,597 --> 00:14:20,182
Okay.

237
00:15:17,406 --> 00:15:19,533
Why don't you put some music on?

238
00:15:23,328 --> 00:15:24,955
Okay.

239
00:15:25,163 --> 00:15:28,292
- Should I ask?
- I wish you wouldn't.

240
00:15:33,505 --> 00:15:36,758
I'm not supposed to play this
because my mom says it's too violent.

241
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:38,385
It has to be violent.

242
00:15:38,552 --> 00:15:40,470
You can't negotiate with zombies.

243
00:15:41,805 --> 00:15:45,058
- Don't tell me, tell her.
- I don't think she likes me.

244
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:46,935
She doesn't really like anybody.

245
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:49,730
Except the guy who keeps
putting grass in our backyard.

246
00:15:52,107 --> 00:15:54,401
Okay, time for bed.

247
00:15:54,568 --> 00:15:56,653
- Just a little longer.
- I'm not sleepy.

248
00:15:58,614 --> 00:16:00,073
No, him.

249
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:03,076
I get to stay up.

250
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:06,038
- That's not fair.
- Jake.

251
00:16:06,204 --> 00:16:08,665
Just because she's a girl.

252
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:11,376
- Wanna play?
- Oh, no, thanks.

253
00:16:11,543 --> 00:16:13,420
I... I thought maybe we could just talk.

254
00:16:13,962 --> 00:16:17,299
Hang on. Let me just saw off
this zombie's head.

255
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:20,135
Good Lord.

256
00:16:20,302 --> 00:16:21,970
There we go.

257
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:24,348
Now, let me save my work.

258
00:16:24,973 --> 00:16:26,141
Okay, all done.

259
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,352
Wanna have sex?

260
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:34,232
Actually, I do.

261
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,861
But maybe we could spend a little time
getting to know each other first.

262
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,197
All right.

263
00:16:40,364 --> 00:16:41,448
What do you wanna know?

264
00:16:43,283 --> 00:16:45,744
Well, do you have
any brothers or sisters?

265
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:47,829
I do not. How about you?

266
00:16:52,918 --> 00:16:54,127
Well, Charlie.

267
00:16:54,878 --> 00:16:57,547
Oh, right, Charlie.

268
00:17:02,886 --> 00:17:05,180
- Do you like to read?
- Oh, yeah, I love reading.

269
00:17:05,347 --> 00:17:08,266
Oh, great, great, me too.
Read anything good lately?

270
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,727
You mean like books and magazines...

271
00:17:10,894 --> 00:17:13,730
...not billboards
and text messages, right?

272
00:17:15,482 --> 00:17:18,026
- Yeah.
- Then, no.

273
00:17:21,947 --> 00:17:24,074
Do menus count?

274
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,122
Are you ready for me?

275
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:34,918
Mia, if I were any more ready,
I'd be done.

276
00:17:44,845 --> 00:17:46,304
Oh, jeez, I'm sorry. You okay?

277
00:17:46,471 --> 00:17:47,889
- I think so.
- Are you sure?

278
00:17:48,056 --> 00:17:49,850
Yeah, I'm fine.

279
00:17:54,396 --> 00:17:55,605
Are you okay?

280
00:18:09,995 --> 00:18:12,247
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

281
00:18:12,414 --> 00:18:14,457
But I think that's enough foreplay.

282
00:18:17,002 --> 00:18:20,338
You see, the thing for me was
that I never should have gotten married.

283
00:18:20,505 --> 00:18:22,299
I was young,
I didn't know who I was.

284
00:18:22,507 --> 00:18:26,261
And to be completely honest,
I was just afraid of being alone.

285
00:18:29,681 --> 00:18:31,725
Can I share something with you?

286
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:34,769
Yes, please. This is communicating,
this is how we connect.

287
00:18:35,312 --> 00:18:39,482
You shouldn't tell people that stuff,
it makes you sound like a loser.

288
00:18:43,987 --> 00:18:46,489
No, it makes me sound like
a real human being.

289
00:18:46,656 --> 00:18:49,034
A person with feelings and flaws.

290
00:18:50,118 --> 00:18:53,121
Loser.

291
00:18:55,665 --> 00:18:59,502
- Why don't we just go have sex?
- Finally.

292
00:19:07,218 --> 00:19:09,304
Oh, cheer up.

293
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:11,806
It wasn't that bad.

294
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:15,644
There were parts of it that I liked.

295
00:19:16,603 --> 00:19:19,522
Can we please not go over
the game film now?

296
00:19:20,857 --> 00:19:23,610
- What's the big deal?
- What's the big deal?

297
00:19:23,818 --> 00:19:26,237
This is supposed to be the part
that I'm good at.

298
00:19:26,446 --> 00:19:27,614
You are.

299
00:19:27,781 --> 00:19:29,866
It was fine.

300
00:19:32,202 --> 00:19:33,578
I don't wanna hear fine.

301
00:19:33,745 --> 00:19:36,289
I wanna see the top of
your head blow off.

302
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:38,500
It's not a carnival game.

303
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:41,378
The object is not to swing
your mallet and ring my bell.

304
00:19:41,586 --> 00:19:43,630
Well, we disagree.

305
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:46,383
That's just your ego talking.

306
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:47,842
Charlie, listen to me.

307
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:52,555
I love you, not your money or car
or your house or your skills in bed.

308
00:19:53,098 --> 00:19:54,891
What's left?

309
00:19:55,058 --> 00:19:57,018
- Charlie.
- Oh, come on. Come on.

310
00:19:57,185 --> 00:20:00,772
You're saying that if I was some
pencil-weenie guy living in a shack...

311
00:20:00,939 --> 00:20:04,567
...and taking the bus to my job selling
oranges on the freeway off-ramp...

312
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:07,862
- ...you'd still love me?
- Yes, I would still love you.

313
00:20:08,613 --> 00:20:11,408
- Okay, I understand now.
- Good.

314
00:20:11,574 --> 00:20:12,951
You're insane.

315
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:15,537
Why? Because I love the real you?

316
00:20:15,745 --> 00:20:19,165
No, no, because you think
there is a real me.

317
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:23,044
Would you believe I love you
if my eyes had rolled back...

318
00:20:23,211 --> 00:20:24,587
...and my head had blown off?

319
00:20:25,255 --> 00:20:26,297
It would be a start.

320
00:20:27,632 --> 00:20:31,010
All right. I guess we're just
gonna have to try again.

321
00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:35,890
Hang on. Hang on.

322
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:38,768
How am I gonna know
you're not faking it?

323
00:20:38,977 --> 00:20:42,689
If I was gonna fake it, don't you think
I would have done it the first time?

324
00:20:43,857 --> 00:20:45,608
Fair enough.

325
00:20:49,403 --> 00:20:52,197
- Hey, wanna hear something amusing?
- Always.

326
00:20:52,406 --> 00:20:54,032
According to my girlfriend...

327
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:56,952
...underneath all the superficial,
cool stuff in my life...

328
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,579
...there's actually a real me.

329
00:20:59,413 --> 00:21:02,499
- No kidding?
- Apparently, he's quite a guy.

330
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:04,793
I'd like to meet him sometime.

331
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:06,253
Don't hold your breath.

332
00:21:08,672 --> 00:21:11,967
My girlfriend, on the other hand,
has no idea who I really am...

333
00:21:12,175 --> 00:21:13,886
...damn little desire to find out...

334
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:16,722
...and is only interested in
riding me like a mustang...

335
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:19,391
...and draining me of all bodily fluids.

336
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:23,061
How do you feel about that?

337
00:21:23,604 --> 00:21:25,397
I think I love her.

338
00:21:26,523 --> 00:21:27,774
You know what...

339
00:21:27,941 --> 00:21:31,904
...love isn't blind, it's retarded.
