Two and a Half Men S03E20 - Always a Bridesmaid, Never a Burro - Web-DL [KoTuWa]

1
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:09,300
Hey, what are you doing home
in the middle of the afternoon?

2
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:11,636
Look outside.

3
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,725
I guess the day got away from me.

4
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:23,022
- So you still depressed?
- What do you think?

5
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,398
By the looks of things...

6
00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:28,945
...I'd say you're one sad song away
from deep-throating a shotgun.

7
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:31,989
Be a pal and put down a tarp first.

8
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:35,826
How did my life get to this point,
Charlie?

9
00:00:35,993 --> 00:00:38,329
How does how does a man
sink this low?

10
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:41,999
Well, in all fairness,
you had a running start.

11
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:46,045
Sorry, sorry. Go on.

12
00:00:46,754 --> 00:00:48,464
Things were going so well.

13
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:52,510
I had a young, hot girlfriend
who fulfilled all my sexual desires.

14
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:57,098
- How many desires are we talking about?
- Just the one. You know...

15
00:00:58,724 --> 00:01:00,685
...for sex.

16
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,688
But now she's gone.

17
00:01:03,854 --> 00:01:07,233
Buddy, she's not really gone.

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,151
You know where she is.

19
00:01:09,318 --> 00:01:11,070
Yeah.

20
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,322
And where is that, Alan?

21
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,534
Why are you doing this?

22
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:20,705
Say it, Alan. The healing begins
when you can say it out loud.

23
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:26,919
My girlfriend is living with my ex-wife.

24
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,880
You know, I was wrong.

25
00:01:30,297 --> 00:01:33,175
It's not the healing that begins
when you say it out loud...

26
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:35,219
...it's the laughter.

27
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,055
Nice talking to you.

28
00:01:38,222 --> 00:01:39,682
Wait, wait, wait.

29
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,060
Hold on. Don't you wanna hear
how I can help you with all this?

30
00:01:43,227 --> 00:01:46,397
I'm not going back to Tijuana
for another X-rated performance...

31
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,816
...of The Bride and the Burro.

32
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,407
Okay. First of all,
that's not what I was gonna suggest.

33
00:01:56,907 --> 00:02:00,202
But if you recall, that trip
got you through a particularly dark...

34
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:02,079
...depressing part of your divorce.

35
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:05,875
The first time you smiled in months
was when you caught the bouquet.

36
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:07,918
All right,
against my better judgment...

37
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:10,755
...I'm gonna go and ask.
How do you propose to help me?

38
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:14,675
Well, first let's make sure
that we agree on the problem.

39
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:17,636
- Your ex-wife befriended your girlfriend.
- Yes.

40
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:21,390
And your girlfriend has moved in
with your ex-wife.

41
00:02:21,557 --> 00:02:22,600
Yes.

42
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,352
Your ex-wife is turning
your girlfriend against you.

43
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:27,021
Do we have to go through this?

44
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:30,107
Just until it stops being funny.

45
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,405
Anyway, it would seem to me
the simple solution is to find someone...

46
00:02:36,572 --> 00:02:39,241
...to speak to Kandi on your behalf.
Someone she trusts.

47
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:41,785
Yes, that would be great.
Now, what's your point?

48
00:02:41,952 --> 00:02:43,412
Charlie?

49
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:46,290
If you're not coming back...

50
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,752
...at least tell me
where you keep the fresh batteries.

51
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:52,379
I'll be right up.

52
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,673
And it's rechargeable.

53
00:02:57,134 --> 00:03:00,888
My point is,
I'm banging Kandi's mom.

54
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:03,015
What?

55
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,727
You're welcome.

56
00:03:42,554 --> 00:03:44,223
Who is it?

57
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,183
You know damn well who it is.

58
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,769
I'm entertaining.

59
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:52,314
Not as much as you seem to think.

60
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:54,066
Hang on.

61
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:57,027
No, not you. You let go.

62
00:03:57,903 --> 00:03:59,405
Come on in, Alan.

63
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:03,158
- Are you decent?
- He's above average.

64
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:06,495
Just come in.

65
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,084
Come on.

66
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:16,338
Oh, he's cute.
I can see why Kandi likes him.

67
00:04:16,505 --> 00:04:17,756
Used to like him.

68
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:22,928
Oh yeah, I'm so sorry about that.
Come, sit. Let's talk about it.

69
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,222
Are you sure I'm not interrupting?

70
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:26,765
Don't worry about it.

71
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:29,393
Kind of hit
the seventh-inning stretch anyway.

72
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,770
You can go two more innings?

73
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:35,107
Even if I have to start throwing
knuckle balls.

74
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:36,859
Sit down.

75
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:39,028
Okay.

76
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:43,824
So you're Kandi's mom, huh?

77
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:46,076
- Mandi.
- Alan.

78
00:04:46,243 --> 00:04:47,369
Some grip, huh?

79
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:53,876
Well, Mandi, I can see where...

80
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,378
Where your daughter
gets her good looks from.

81
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:59,381
Thank you. You know,
a lot of people think we're sisters.

82
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:03,052
Oh, there's a mental picture that'll get
me through the last two innings.

83
00:05:03,218 --> 00:05:05,804
- Don't be naughty.
- Why, are you gonna spank me?

84
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:08,390
- I just might.
- I just might let you.

85
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:11,351
I just might go hang myself.

86
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,062
Oh, relax.

87
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:16,106
Oh, Kandi said he was a little shy.

88
00:05:16,273 --> 00:05:18,942
First time they had sex,
he didn't take his shirt off.

89
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:20,986
Excuse me, that wasn't shyness.

90
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:24,573
The first time I had sex with your
daughter, I barely got my pants off.

91
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,703
Whoa, whoa, whoa, boundaries.
This is Kandi's mom.

92
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,249
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to create an awkward moment.

93
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:38,295
But enough about me.

94
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:42,424
How is it that you two are...

95
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:44,510
I mean, you know...

96
00:05:44,676 --> 00:05:47,054
...how did you exactly...?

97
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:49,848
What the hell is going on here?

98
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,227
Good question, and a great story.

99
00:05:53,393 --> 00:05:55,979
Mandi showed up here
looking for Kandi.

100
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,358
That's not a great story.

101
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:03,946
Sure it is. It's already had like
half a dozen happy endings.

102
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:06,907
You are definitely going over my knee.

103
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:08,825
Alan, we gotta wrap it up here.

104
00:06:08,992 --> 00:06:11,078
But you said
you'd help me with Kandi.

105
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,704
I didn't say now.

106
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:15,874
- Do you want me to talk to her?
- I would really appreciate it.

107
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,878
Excuse me, but the pitcher's all
warmed up and ready to take the mound.

108
00:06:20,837 --> 00:06:23,507
Of course,
I'm kind of busy at the moment.

109
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,467
Got it.

110
00:06:30,514 --> 00:06:33,267
Oh, charge!

111
00:06:40,857 --> 00:06:43,402
- Hey, Dad. Mom, Dad's here.
- Hey.

112
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,280
No, don't, don't bother your mom.
Is Kandi around?

113
00:06:46,446 --> 00:06:48,991
- Yeah, she lives here now.
- I know.

114
00:06:49,157 --> 00:06:51,702
Does this mean she and Mom are gay?

115
00:06:53,537 --> 00:06:56,123
- No, it does not.
- Too bad.

116
00:06:57,624 --> 00:07:01,128
- Why?
- Be a lot easier to explain.

117
00:07:02,337 --> 00:07:07,175
- Could you just tell Kandi I'm here?
- Okay. Kandi, my dad's here.

118
00:07:08,552 --> 00:07:11,013
- What do you want, Alan?
- I wanna talk to Kandi.

119
00:07:11,179 --> 00:07:13,223
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Why?

120
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,685
She's a sweet, innocent girl.
I don't want you to ruin her life too.

121
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:20,188
- Too? How did I ruin your life?
- You stole my youth.

122
00:07:20,355 --> 00:07:21,690
You took my house.

123
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:26,028
That seems like a fair trade.

124
00:07:26,403 --> 00:07:29,448
Face it. This escapade with Kandi
is just a pathetic attempt...

125
00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:31,992
...to find a younger version of me.

126
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:35,704
Are you kidding?
Judith, I had a younger version of you...

127
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:38,331
...and let me tell you,
it was no great shakes.

128
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,044
It's okay, Judith. I'll talk to him.

129
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,048
He doesn't want to talk to you. There's
only one thing a man is interested in.

130
00:07:46,423 --> 00:07:47,924
What?

131
00:07:48,884 --> 00:07:50,761
Forget it. I'm here if you need me.

132
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:54,931
Hello, Alan.

133
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:58,852
Listen, Kandi,
I'm really sorry about our fight.

134
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:02,147
I know I can be a little bit
of a control freak and...

135
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:05,275
But I honestly care for you...

136
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:07,527
...and I hope you'll give me
another chance.

137
00:08:07,694 --> 00:08:10,197
I see. Excuse me.

138
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:18,747
I can't let you steal my youth.

139
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:23,376
You're not fooling anybody, Judith.

140
00:08:23,543 --> 00:08:25,587
Come on, Kandi,
tell me what you think.

141
00:08:25,754 --> 00:08:30,383
Okay. I think we've reached
an implants in our relationship.

142
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,594
Impasse.

143
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:38,016
I think we've reached an impasse
in our relationship. Goodbye.

144
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:47,317
Excuse me,
is this Judith Harper's house?

145
00:08:47,484 --> 00:08:49,736
Yeah. She traded it for her youth.

146
00:08:56,034 --> 00:08:58,495
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetheart.

147
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:02,499
Come on in.
Judith can't wait to meet you.

148
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:03,959
I can't wait to meet her.

149
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:07,587
I know you two
are gonna love each other.

150
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:10,924
I watch one donkey sex show...

151
00:09:11,091 --> 00:09:14,094
...and you make me pay for it
the rest of my life.

152
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,477
Who is it?

153
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,814
Don't screw with me, Charlie.
We need to talk.

154
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:27,566
Give me a sec.

155
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:30,443
Charlie, you're just making it tighter.

156
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,738
Oh, the hell with it. Come on in, Alan.

157
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:39,869
- Hey there.
- Hiya.

158
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:45,875
- You know, I can come back.
- It's okay, Alan. Come, sit.

159
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:48,753
All right.

160
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:54,467
So how did it go with Kandi?

161
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,052
If it had gone well...

162
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:59,598
...do you think I'd be sitting here
talking to two half-naked people?

163
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:01,266
- Alan?
- What?

164
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:03,268
I'm completely naked.

165
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:06,813
What happened, Alan?

166
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:11,526
Well, as I suspected, Judith has turned
your daughter against me.

167
00:10:11,693 --> 00:10:15,238
Well, I'm not surprised.
Kandi's always been very suggestible.

168
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:19,034
You know, until she was 8
she thought this was her nose.

169
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,285
That's kind of cute.

170
00:10:20,452 --> 00:10:24,331
When Alan was 8, I convinced him
he only had two weeks to live.

171
00:10:24,497 --> 00:10:27,876
But I suppose that tells you more
about me than him.

172
00:10:28,376 --> 00:10:31,212
Yeah, good times.

173
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,759
But back to recent events...

174
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:40,472
Remember when I told you the cat-litter
box was filled with Almond Roca?

175
00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:42,432
He ate four of them.

176
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:47,395
Are we done visiting Charlie Harper's
Museum of Sibling Cruelty?

177
00:10:49,022 --> 00:10:50,648
I have something to talk about.

178
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:54,694
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize I was interrupting you.

179
00:10:55,737 --> 00:10:56,863
Go ahead, Alan.

180
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,073
Thank you.

181
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:00,241
So as I was leaving
my ex-wife's house...

182
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:02,202
...I ran into your ex-husband.

183
00:11:02,368 --> 00:11:03,828
- Andy?
- I guess.

184
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:07,707
Wait a second.
It's Mandi, Andy and Kandi?

185
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,168
What's your point?

186
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,629
No point.

187
00:11:13,546 --> 00:11:15,632
Mandi, Andy, Kandi.

188
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:17,258
Dandy.

189
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:24,557
Anyway, it appears as if Kandi has set
my ex-wife up on a blind date with him.

190
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:26,309
How nice.

191
00:11:26,476 --> 00:11:27,936
Nice? How is that nice?

192
00:11:28,103 --> 00:11:30,605
Well, he's been kind of depressed
since we broke up.

193
00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:33,066
It's good to see
he's getting back on the horse.

194
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:36,111
But that horse is my ex-wife.

195
00:11:36,277 --> 00:11:39,781
Speaking of which, did you ever see
The Bride and the Burro in Tijuana?

196
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:42,742
See it? I caught the bouquet.

197
00:11:43,576 --> 00:11:45,411
So did Alan.

198
00:11:47,664 --> 00:11:50,124
Always a bridesmaid, never a burro.

199
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:54,504
Charlie,
I'm starting to lose feeling in my arm.

200
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:56,047
Oh, I'm sorry.

201
00:11:56,214 --> 00:11:59,342
Hey, you went pretty far in the scouts.
Can you undo this knot?

202
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:01,928
Gee, actually,
I specialized in Indian lore.

203
00:12:02,095 --> 00:12:05,265
Beaded belts, arrowheads.
But, good luck though.

204
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:08,226
Maybe you should go get
a pair of scissors.

205
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:11,437
Hang on, let me untie my feet.

206
00:12:14,357 --> 00:12:17,235
We really didn't think this through,
did we?

207
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:25,118
So has your mom
been seeing a lot of Kandi's dad?

208
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:30,707
That's right. If she married him,
Kandi would be your stepsister.

209
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:35,253
Hey, hey, hey, do you happen to know
if they're going out tonight?

210
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:39,215
Yep, if I married Kandi,
she would be your stepmother.

211
00:12:39,382 --> 00:12:40,800
But...

212
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:44,178
But tonight...
Is your mom going out tonight?

213
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:49,517
Yeah, yeah, I get it. If Kandi
took a poop, it would be your step-stool.

214
00:13:00,153 --> 00:13:02,238
All right, well...

215
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,991
...it's always good to talk to you.

216
00:13:05,867 --> 00:13:07,785
Love you, buddy.

217
00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:10,330
Did you get all that, Berta?

218
00:13:11,247 --> 00:13:14,042
I think so, but let's do a quick recap.

219
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,336
Your girlfriend's
living with your ex-wife.

220
00:13:16,502 --> 00:13:19,088
Your ex-wife's
dating your girlfriend's father.

221
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:22,050
To top it off,
you're trying to get useful intelligence...

222
00:13:22,216 --> 00:13:24,802
...from a kid who's got
precious little to spare.

223
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:27,013
Okay, just checking.

224
00:13:27,597 --> 00:13:28,640
Hey, Berta.

225
00:13:29,432 --> 00:13:31,851
- I want you to meet Mandi. Mandi, Berta.
- Hi.

226
00:13:34,437 --> 00:13:36,022
Listen...

227
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:38,191
...we got a pair of scissors handy?

228
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:40,777
Oh, Charlie, that's a silk tie.

229
00:13:40,943 --> 00:13:43,363
Why didn't you use
one of the poly blends?

230
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:47,116
Hey, hey, wait a minute, that's my tie.
You ruined my tie.

231
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:48,910
Oh, yeah.

232
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:52,747
You're not gonna be happy
about your electric toothbrush either.

233
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:57,543
Kandi's told me
so many nice things about you.

234
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,920
How do you know Kandi?

235
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:01,297
- She's my daughter.
- Your daughter?

236
00:14:01,464 --> 00:14:03,007
Sweet whistling Geronimo.

237
00:14:03,174 --> 00:14:07,345
You people are like a box of hamsters,
just crawling all over each other.

238
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,098
Yes, yes.

239
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:14,143
- We all get how this looks, Berta.
- Hey, I'm not knocking it.

240
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,980
I'm just wondering when some of that
gravy's gonna spill over on my taters.

241
00:14:27,907 --> 00:14:28,950
Hey, what's up?

242
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:32,829
What's up? What are you doing here?

243
00:14:32,995 --> 00:14:35,581
Well, Mandi came over
to put in a good word for you...

244
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:38,501
...and I figured I'd tag along for grins.

245
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,546
Here comes one now.

246
00:14:43,923 --> 00:14:45,591
Come on in.

247
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:49,804
I'm in a nightmare
and I can't wake up.

248
00:14:51,013 --> 00:14:52,932
Sit down. Make yourself at home.

249
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:58,020
Thanks...

250
00:14:58,187 --> 00:14:59,397
...I will.

251
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,025
- Where's... Where's Jake?
- He's at a sleepover.

252
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:05,444
Hi, Alan.

253
00:15:05,611 --> 00:15:06,863
How are you?

254
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:09,866
About two heartbeats
from a brain aneurysm.

255
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,243
Where's Kandi?

256
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:15,079
She's in her room.
But I thought we should talk first.

257
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:20,001
We just have a few questions.

258
00:15:20,334 --> 00:15:21,377
About what?

259
00:15:22,253 --> 00:15:23,754
Charlie?

260
00:15:23,921 --> 00:15:28,134
Well, Kandi's mom and I are
a little concerned about your intentions.

261
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:33,598
You should be...

262
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:35,433
...because I intend to kill you.

263
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:41,147
That's the kind of attitude...

264
00:15:41,314 --> 00:15:44,734
...that isn't gonna win you
a lot of friends around here, mister.

265
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:47,653
Alan, you're a very sweet man.

266
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,155
But let's face facts.

267
00:15:49,322 --> 00:15:52,283
Kandi has her whole life ahead of her,
while you...

268
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,493
...not so much.

269
00:15:55,828 --> 00:15:58,331
- Kandi?
- Alan?

270
00:15:58,497 --> 00:16:01,000
- I am so sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

271
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,754
Oh, isn't that sweet?

272
00:16:06,088 --> 00:16:08,799
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you too, huggy bear.

273
00:16:09,175 --> 00:16:12,136
Mom, I'm gonna go have sex with Alan,
okay?

274
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:14,263
You kids have fun.

275
00:16:16,265 --> 00:16:19,185
- Hold on there, young man.
- What?

276
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:22,772
Don't be a selfish lover.
Consider her needs.

277
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,108
This isn't over.

278
00:16:30,738 --> 00:16:34,533
You're right.
He is easy to screw with.

279
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,121
Hey, four pieces of Almond Roca.
Even the cat was laughing at him.

280
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:42,625
So should we head back to my place?

281
00:16:43,584 --> 00:16:44,877
I suppose.

282
00:16:45,294 --> 00:16:46,462
What's wrong?

283
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:48,631
Nothing. It's just...

284
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:50,716
...we've already had sex there.

285
00:16:50,883 --> 00:16:54,387
Oh, baby. I really, really like you.

286
00:16:55,262 --> 00:16:57,723
Well, thank you, Judith.
I had a wonderful evening.

287
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,476
I hope we can do it again some...

288
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:09,527
Maybe catch a movie.

289
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:12,822
Or go for a hike.

290
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:17,743
I'm guessing that's your ex-husband.

291
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,246
- Good-looking man.
- Oh, he's gorgeous.

292
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:21,664
Dumb as wood.

293
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:23,124
Oh, my Lord.

294
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,918
But it's good wood.

295
00:17:27,795 --> 00:17:32,258
- I better find Alan so we can get out.
- You wanna leave? This is so hot.

296
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:36,345
Oh, Mandi, you just keep getting better
and better.

297
00:17:36,512 --> 00:17:41,142
- Hang on while I give Alan a heads up.
- Hurry back and give me one.

298
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:51,986
Alan?

299
00:17:56,949 --> 00:17:58,534
Alan?

300
00:17:58,701 --> 00:18:01,579
You're the most beautiful man
I've ever seen.

301
00:18:01,745 --> 00:18:03,539
Not Alan.

302
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,418
Couldn't find him.

303
00:18:08,878 --> 00:18:10,379
Mandi.

304
00:18:10,754 --> 00:18:12,131
Mandi.

305
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:14,091
You know what else I like?
Swap meets.

306
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:16,177
- Swell.
- Yeah.

307
00:18:16,343 --> 00:18:19,138
Your ex-husband
must be a real little guy, huh?

308
00:18:19,305 --> 00:18:22,433
Forget about him.
Let's get some wine in you.

309
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,482
Mandi.

310
00:18:30,858 --> 00:18:32,985
Glasses are in there.

311
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:36,906
No, no, top shelf.

312
00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:44,622
That's what I'm talking about.

313
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:52,588
Hey, you ever go rock climbing?
It's a great workout.

314
00:18:56,717 --> 00:18:58,594
Mandi?

315
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:04,850
Mandi.

316
00:19:06,226 --> 00:19:07,895
Alan?

317
00:19:08,395 --> 00:19:10,356
- Anybody?
- Over here.

318
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:16,528
Damn it.

319
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:23,285
- What are you doing?
- I was thirsty.

320
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:27,539
- Have you seen Alan?
- I've been in the closet.

321
00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:29,583
So where the hell is he?

322
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,794
Oh, my, I'm sorry I'm so nervous.

323
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,296
I haven't been with another woman
in a long time.

324
00:19:34,463 --> 00:19:37,299
Yeah, yeah, take off your robe.

325
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:38,926
Okay.

326
00:19:39,385 --> 00:19:41,804
Hot damn.

327
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:45,557
Yeah, it is hot.

328
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:56,276
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, Judith.

329
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,906
Daddy,
I want you to meet my boyfriend, Alan.

330
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,576
- Nice to see you again.
- Small world.

331
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:15,129
- I said I was sorry.
- Just get out.

332
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:19,091
I'll give you a call, Judith.
Maybe we'll hit some garage sales.

333
00:20:19,258 --> 00:20:21,093
Yeah, terrific.

334
00:20:25,931 --> 00:20:27,474
I like your daughter.

335
00:20:28,225 --> 00:20:30,269
I like your ex-wife.

336
00:20:31,687 --> 00:20:32,813
Wanna get a drink?

337
00:20:34,606 --> 00:20:36,108
I'm not doing anything.

338
00:20:38,235 --> 00:20:40,696
Do you like garage sales?

339
00:20:41,905 --> 00:20:44,032
Where am I supposed to go?

340
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:46,660
I don't care. Just leave.

341
00:20:46,827 --> 00:20:48,704
But I thought we were friends.

342
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:53,041
Friends don't have sex with their friends'
ex-husbands in the first friend's hot tub.

343
00:20:57,337 --> 00:21:00,424
Divorced three years
and he's still ruining my life.

344
00:21:00,591 --> 00:21:03,719
Should have drowned his stupid ass.

345
00:21:07,055 --> 00:21:09,516
- Did you hear something?
- Nope.

346
00:21:09,683 --> 00:21:12,019
- How's the head?
- Let's find out.
