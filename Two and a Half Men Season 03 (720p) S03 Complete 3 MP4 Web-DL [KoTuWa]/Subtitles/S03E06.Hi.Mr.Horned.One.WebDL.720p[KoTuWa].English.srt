Two and a Half Men S03E06 - Hi, Mr. Horned One - Web-DL [KoTuWa]

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,965
That's a cool snake tattoo
on your back.

3
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:12,970
Thanks. That's Anacoth,
the demon who eats human souls.

4
00:00:13,137 --> 00:00:16,182
My friend Jeffrey has a dog
that eats its own poop.

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,601
He tries to lick our face
but we don't let him.

6
00:00:19,852 --> 00:00:22,313
- Okay.
- Who's that one?

7
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,899
That's the Goddess of the Damned.

8
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,151
She whose name cannot be spoken.

9
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:30,321
- Why, is it hard to pronounce?
- What?

10
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:35,368
We have a friend at school like that.
He's from India. We just call him Rusty.

11
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,203
No kidding.

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,121
- Does it hurt to get tattoos?
- Yeah.

13
00:00:39,288 --> 00:00:41,874
- But it's worth it, you know?
- Sure.

14
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:45,086
Once I bit my tongue really hard
eating a frozen Milky Way...

15
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,797
...but it was totally worth it.

16
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,301
- Good morning.
- Hey, Dad.

17
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:55,805
- Hey.
- Hi, I'm Alan, Jake's dad.

18
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,683
- Isabella.
- She's a friend of Uncle Charlie's.

19
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,769
I would hope so.

20
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,230
Yeah,
and she was showing me her tattoos.

21
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,439
Lucky you.

22
00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:09,402
There was a time you'd have to pay a
quarter and go into a tent to see that.

23
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,697
Now it's right at your breakfast table.

24
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:16,367
- Go get dressed.
- I wanna see the rest of her tattoos.

25
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,994
- Go.
- I have a quarter.

26
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,495
Jake.

27
00:01:20,037 --> 00:01:21,998
All right.

28
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:27,378
Isabella, I hate to be a fuddy-duddy
but we keep the house smoke free.

29
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,422
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:35,302
Charlie didn't say anything
when I was smoking in bed last night.

31
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:39,724
Yeah, well, Charlie's lungs aren't always
on the same page as his penis.

32
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,019
- Morning, baby.
- Hey.

33
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:54,905
If you don't like it, don't watch.

34
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:01,412
I'm gonna go upstairs
and take a shower. You wanna join me?

35
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:05,416
Sure. Just let me get some fluids in me
so I got something to work with.

36
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,794
Hurry. Anacoth is hungry.

37
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,466
Anacoth is hungry?

38
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:15,551
She's referring to her snake tattoo.

39
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,431
Her vagina is called Linda.

40
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:23,476
Pretty name.

41
00:02:23,642 --> 00:02:25,644
Listen,
I don't wanna overstep my bounds.

42
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:28,814
This is your house and you're free
to bring into it whoever...

43
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:30,858
...or whatever you choose.

44
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,693
But I do think I have the right...

45
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,613
...to protect Jake
from being exposed to certain people.

46
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:37,656
Well, you'd better take him to a hotel.

47
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:40,451
Because that girl ain't leaving
till one of us is dead.

48
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,952
- Come on, Charlie.
- No. No.

49
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:44,747
You come on.
You see a little body ink and cigarette...

50
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,582
...and you immediately condemn her.

51
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:49,084
She's smart,
she's got a great sense of humor...

52
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:53,380
...and in bed she moves like one of those
paint shakers at Sherwin-Williams.

53
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:01,430
Nevertheless, I would rather
she didn't hang around Jake.

54
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:02,973
Fine. I'll talk to her.

55
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,017
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

56
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,436
Now, unless you wanna lather up
my fanny...

57
00:03:07,603 --> 00:03:10,940
...I'm gonna go hop in the shower
with Anacoth and Linda.

58
00:03:49,436 --> 00:03:52,439
Isabella. I... I didn't hear you come in.

59
00:03:52,606 --> 00:03:53,815
You weren't meant to.

60
00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:56,526
So...

61
00:03:57,944 --> 00:04:00,155
...you think I'm a bad influence
on your kid?

62
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:04,534
Well, gee, I wouldn't put it that way.

63
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:06,703
But, you know,
kids are impressionable.

64
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,875
And the violent psycho-sexual imagery
of your body art...

65
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,794
...not to mention the smoking...

66
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,672
...aren't something a young boy
needs to... Why are you taking my hair?

67
00:04:18,465 --> 00:04:20,300
Just a little quirk of mine.

68
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:27,516
I used to collect stamps.

69
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:31,478
You know, people like you
have been persecuting people like me...

70
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:33,813
...for thousands of years.

71
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:38,109
Well, that's a bit hard to believe.

72
00:04:38,276 --> 00:04:42,656
Seeing as people like me
have historically been victims and food.

73
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,493
But just for clarity...

74
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,162
...who exactly are the people like you?

75
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:53,416
Those whose eyes are open to a greater
reality than you could ever imagine.

76
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,627
I see.

77
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:58,922
And do they all collect hair?

78
00:05:00,173 --> 00:05:03,760
- Don't mock what you don't understand.
- I'm sorry.

79
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:08,348
I tend to resort to mocking
when I'm totally creeped out.

80
00:05:09,182 --> 00:05:10,517
I don't like you.

81
00:05:11,893 --> 00:05:13,270
Yeah, well...

82
00:05:13,436 --> 00:05:16,439
...I'm rubber, you're glue.

83
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:19,818
Something, something, something, you.

84
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:24,364
So be it.

85
00:05:28,535 --> 00:05:30,412
So be it.

86
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:36,710
So be it.

87
00:05:43,717 --> 00:05:45,343
Damn it.

88
00:05:50,932 --> 00:05:52,976
What the hell?

89
00:05:59,357 --> 00:06:00,775
I don't think so, Mom.

90
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:05,113
First of all, I'm just not a big fan
of costume parties.

91
00:06:07,657 --> 00:06:11,244
Yeah, Jake likes The Wizard of Oz.
I don't think he'd enjoy hanging out...

92
00:06:11,411 --> 00:06:15,415
...with a bunch of drunken real-estate
agents dressed like Judy Garland.

93
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:17,959
Okay, I'll get him.

94
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,171
Mom wants to ask you something.

95
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:24,174
Hi, Mom. No.

96
00:06:27,844 --> 00:06:29,637
What happened to your face?

97
00:06:29,804 --> 00:06:34,017
Nothing, I just thought I'd put little
blood-soaked pieces of toilet paper on it.

98
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:36,436
What do you think?

99
00:06:36,895 --> 00:06:38,605
It suits you.

100
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:43,568
- What's the deal with your eye?
- I don't know. I think I'm getting a sty.

101
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:46,654
Might be a bit much
with the toilet paper.

102
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:48,531
I'd go with one or the other.

103
00:06:48,698 --> 00:06:51,743
- Thank you for your input.
- No problem.

104
00:06:51,993 --> 00:06:54,454
- Where you going?
- Isabella's taking me to a party.

105
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:56,498
She said it's gonna be out of control.

106
00:06:56,664 --> 00:06:59,793
Can you imagine what this girl
considers to be out of control?

107
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:03,463
Well, let's see.
Biting the head off a live chicken?

108
00:07:04,964 --> 00:07:06,424
Vivisecting homeless people...

109
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:09,552
...and playing Hacky Sack
with their still-beating hearts?

110
00:07:10,094 --> 00:07:11,471
What are you talking about?

111
00:07:11,638 --> 00:07:14,307
Do you have any idea
what Isabella is really into?

112
00:07:14,474 --> 00:07:16,059
So she's a little kinky.

113
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:19,479
No, no, no.
Kinky is a feather duster up your butt.

114
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:22,857
I think this woman
tried to put a curse on me.

115
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:25,151
Oh, please.
Who of us hasn't done that?

116
00:07:26,444 --> 00:07:28,196
To know you is to curse you.

117
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:29,656
She took my hair.

118
00:07:31,282 --> 00:07:32,659
- She took your hair?
- Yeah.

119
00:07:32,826 --> 00:07:35,578
Yeah. And then she laughed like:

120
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,085
- Oh, well, that's different.
- So you see my concern?

121
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:44,128
Yes, I do. Good night.

122
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:46,214
Where you going?

123
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:48,883
To pick up a bottle of wine
and a feather duster.

124
00:07:55,306 --> 00:07:57,684
You sure my Mercedes
is okay parked on the street?

125
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,271
I mean, I gave that crack whore $10
to watch it but now I'm thinking...

126
00:08:01,437 --> 00:08:03,231
...who's watching the crack whore?

127
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,984
Don't worry about your car.

128
00:08:09,112 --> 00:08:10,697
Okay.

129
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:17,870
So where are all the guys?

130
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:21,249
How come I'm the only weenie
in this pot of beans?

131
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:25,253
- Because this party is in your honor.
- Really? What did I do?

132
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,672
You're a vessel of the masculine
life force.

133
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,465
You picked up on that?

134
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:32,802
I tell people that all the time
and they just get snotty.

135
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:37,557
These women are all my sisters.
They all want to please you.

136
00:08:41,144 --> 00:08:43,938
Well, gosh, that's swell.

137
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:47,567
- Then you're okay with this?
- Lt was my idea.

138
00:08:47,734 --> 00:08:51,946
Let me tell you something, Isabella,
you are just tops in my book.

139
00:08:53,531 --> 00:08:55,616
This is very tasty.
What'd you say this was?

140
00:08:55,783 --> 00:08:58,703
- A secret elixir.
- Secret elixir, huh?

141
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,497
I'm more of a bourbon guy
but push comes to shove...

142
00:09:01,664 --> 00:09:03,916
...I don't know
what the hell's in that either.

143
00:09:06,002 --> 00:09:09,589
Oh, boy.
Getting a little fuzzy around the edges.

144
00:09:11,382 --> 00:09:12,800
Got any crackers?

145
00:09:14,093 --> 00:09:17,930
- He's ready.
- You bet your Gothic ass I am.

146
00:09:23,394 --> 00:09:25,772
- Where are we going?
- To the altar room.

147
00:09:25,938 --> 00:09:28,733
Oh, boy. What's the altar room?

148
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,109
It's where we anoint you.

149
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:33,446
Oh, boy. I'm getting anointed.

150
00:09:33,613 --> 00:09:35,448
Sounds nasty.

151
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:37,950
- Anoint him.
- Anoint him.

152
00:09:38,117 --> 00:09:39,160
Anoint him.

153
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,411
Anoint him.

154
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:44,290
Anoint him. Anoint him. Anoint him.

155
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:49,087
Anoint him. Anoint him. Anoint him.

156
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:53,716
Anoint him. Anoint him. Anoint him.

157
00:09:53,883 --> 00:09:56,344
Anoint him. Anoint him.

158
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,437
- Morning.
- Morning.

159
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:08,981
Great googly-mooglies.

160
00:10:09,398 --> 00:10:12,693
- What the hell happened to you?
- I'm not sure.

161
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,280
Looks like you got bit in the face
by one of them Ebola monkeys.

162
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:17,824
I don't think so, Berta.

163
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,660
I mean,
you weren't exactly eye-candy going in.

164
00:10:22,036 --> 00:10:23,663
But now:

165
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,499
You could scare the flies
off a manure truck.

166
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:31,254
Thank you. Until you said that
I was feeling a little self-conscious.

167
00:10:31,671 --> 00:10:34,215
- You know I'm razzing you, don't you?
- Yeah.

168
00:10:34,382 --> 00:10:38,678
I mean, it's really not that... Oh,
sweet lord, I'm gonna lose my Eggos.

169
00:10:38,845 --> 00:10:43,683
Okay, if open-mike night
in the burn ward is over...

170
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,020
...I'm gonna make breakfast and get out
before Charlie's new girlfriend gets up.

171
00:10:48,187 --> 00:10:50,314
Why,
is she not as compassionate as me?

172
00:10:51,357 --> 00:10:52,984
She's just a very creepy woman.

173
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,571
Well, putting aside
the whole pot-kettle thing, creepy how?

174
00:10:57,446 --> 00:11:00,449
Well, she's got tattoos all over her.

175
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:02,577
I've got tattoos.

176
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:06,622
And she's got this very dark,
hostile attitude.

177
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:10,042
Okay, you might actually like her...

178
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:13,045
...but I don't want to have anything
to do with her.

179
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:14,797
Good morning.

180
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:17,633
Isabella. Hello.

181
00:11:18,342 --> 00:11:20,636
That's a nasty looking eye
you've got there.

182
00:11:21,137 --> 00:11:22,972
It's just a sty.

183
00:11:25,308 --> 00:11:26,642
Right?

184
00:11:28,311 --> 00:11:29,770
What else would it be?

185
00:11:32,106 --> 00:11:34,358
Hey, Vampira...

186
00:11:35,568 --> 00:11:38,779
...tell Count Humpula to get out of bed
so I can change his sheets.

187
00:11:41,407 --> 00:11:43,826
Charlie and I are spending the entire day
in bed.

188
00:11:43,993 --> 00:11:47,204
We do not want to be disturbed.
Do you understand?

189
00:11:49,498 --> 00:11:52,168
Is it getting cold in here?

190
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,421
Do you understand?

191
00:11:55,588 --> 00:11:56,839
Yep. You betcha.

192
00:11:58,132 --> 00:11:59,383
Thank you.

193
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:02,887
Bye, Alan. Take care of that eye.

194
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:07,224
I will. Thank you.
You see what I mean about...?

195
00:12:09,602 --> 00:12:11,020
- What are you doing?
- Leaving.

196
00:12:11,187 --> 00:12:14,690
- Why?
- Did you see that bitch?

197
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:20,321
You gotta put a whole lot of gone
between you and a broad like that.

198
00:12:22,114 --> 00:12:24,492
- But wait a second...
- Goodbye and good luck.

199
00:12:48,182 --> 00:12:49,809
That is some sty.

200
00:12:49,975 --> 00:12:52,728
This is no sty. This is something else.
Something evil.

201
00:12:52,895 --> 00:12:54,730
Something ugly.

202
00:12:54,897 --> 00:12:57,817
You know what? I'm starting to think
your girlfriend did this.

203
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,445
- Oh, come on.
- Charlie, this isn't just about me.

204
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:04,323
Have you taken a look
at yourself recently?

205
00:13:04,573 --> 00:13:06,534
Oh, man.

206
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,080
It's gonna take more than
a little spray-on tan to fix that.

207
00:13:11,247 --> 00:13:14,250
Do you realize how long
you've been upstairs with her?

208
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,584
- That depends.
- On what?

209
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:17,128
On what day it is.

210
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:21,090
It's Sunday evening. I haven't seen you
since you went to that party.

211
00:13:21,257 --> 00:13:23,134
Oh, yeah, the party.

212
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,594
- That was some great party.
- What happened?

213
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:27,596
I have no idea.

214
00:13:28,597 --> 00:13:30,266
Although, I did wake up with this.

215
00:13:32,726 --> 00:13:36,647
- Oh, my God.
- Am I Jewish now?

216
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:43,571
Charlie, that's not the Star of David,
it's a pentagram.

217
00:13:43,737 --> 00:13:46,782
It's a satanic symbol
used to call forth demons from hell.

218
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:49,952
Oh, that's not good.

219
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:53,330
- You need to cut Isabella loose.
- I can't.

220
00:13:53,497 --> 00:13:54,623
Why not?

221
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,459
Because together we shall spawn
a child named Giglamesh.. <i>(Gilgamesh!?)</i>

222
00:13:57,626 --> 00:14:00,713
And he shall bring forth
a new age of darkness.

223
00:14:02,548 --> 00:14:05,885
You know, maybe it's time to slow
this relationship down a little bit.

224
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:09,430
Slow it down? You need to drive a stake
through its heart.

225
00:14:09,597 --> 00:14:12,474
- Is she still here?
- Yeah.

226
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:14,560
Okay, here's the plan.

227
00:14:14,727 --> 00:14:18,939
So we'll submit to her will and serve the
Lord Beelzebub with all our hearts.

228
00:14:20,232 --> 00:14:21,275
I'll grab Jake.

229
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:24,903
You start the car. We'll drive somewhere
safe. I'm thinking the Vatican.

230
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:28,782
- Don't be ridiculous.
- What are you gonna do?

231
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:32,077
- You said it. We have to cut her loose.
- "We"? I didn't say "we."

232
00:14:32,244 --> 00:14:33,829
I never said "we."

233
00:14:34,955 --> 00:14:38,334
Hear us, oh, Horned One.

234
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,087
Wrap your dark wings
around this young soul...

235
00:14:42,254 --> 00:14:46,175
...and grant him
all the rewards he desires.

236
00:14:48,218 --> 00:14:52,097
Okay, hi, Mr. Horned One.

237
00:14:55,017 --> 00:14:58,354
Here's the deal,
I'll trade you my soul for...

238
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,689
What do I get, like, three wishes?

239
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:03,817
He's the Lord of the Underworld,
not a genie.

240
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:07,071
Oh, okay. Can I talk to a genie?

241
00:15:09,031 --> 00:15:10,449
Jake, get over here.

242
00:15:10,616 --> 00:15:13,577
Sorry, Dad,
but you're no longer my master.

243
00:15:13,744 --> 00:15:15,704
The hell I'm not. Go to your room.

244
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:17,956
I'm old enough
to choose my own religion.

245
00:15:18,123 --> 00:15:19,583
Go.

246
00:15:23,045 --> 00:15:24,963
How dare you interfere?

247
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,548
Good question.

248
00:15:26,715 --> 00:15:30,052
Alan, tell her how we dare.

249
00:15:30,803 --> 00:15:33,389
Hey, you brought her here,
you get her out.

250
00:15:33,555 --> 00:15:35,432
Are you trying to get rid of me?

251
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:38,811
Okay, well, no, not you personally.

252
00:15:38,977 --> 00:15:40,771
This is more of a legal issue.

253
00:15:40,938 --> 00:15:44,441
It turns out Malibu is not zoned
for satanic rituals.

254
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,071
Or any of the black arts, really.
Right, Alan?

255
00:15:49,238 --> 00:15:51,657
That's true. You're fine in Hollywood.

256
00:15:53,742 --> 00:15:57,454
Pretty much anywhere
east of the 405 freeway, actually.

257
00:15:57,621 --> 00:16:00,582
- Shut up, Alan.
- Just trying to help.

258
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,252
Did you really think
that you can end this?

259
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:05,087
I was kind of hoping.

260
00:16:05,504 --> 00:16:08,423
Don't you realize that our souls
are now bound together...

261
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,094
...destined to writhe ecstatically
in blessed hellfire for all eternity?

262
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:19,059
Boy, I know how to pick them,
don't I?

263
00:16:19,852 --> 00:16:24,064
Charlie, do you remember
the vows you took last night?

264
00:16:25,023 --> 00:16:27,109
- Vows?
- You took vows? What kind of vows?

265
00:16:27,276 --> 00:16:29,444
If you'll shut up, maybe we'll find out.

266
00:16:30,737 --> 00:16:33,991
You vowed unending fealty
to the sisterhood of the coven.

267
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:36,285
You did that? Why would you do that?

268
00:16:36,451 --> 00:16:37,786
Will you please shut up?

269
00:16:39,538 --> 00:16:42,040
I did that? Why would I do that?

270
00:16:42,207 --> 00:16:45,002
Did you think those beautiful women
were pleasuring you...

271
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:47,171
...because of your boyish charm?

272
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:50,340
Well. No, not all of them.

273
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,762
I just figured after the first three or four,
word of mouth started to spread.

274
00:16:58,682 --> 00:17:01,685
Wait, wait, how many women
are we talking about here?

275
00:17:01,852 --> 00:17:03,145
I don't know. Nine, 10...

276
00:17:03,312 --> 00:17:06,982
Thirteen. The sacred number.

277
00:17:07,441 --> 00:17:10,068
And a personal best for me.

278
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:14,156
How do you have sex
with 13 women at one time?

279
00:17:14,323 --> 00:17:17,326
Well, apparently,
you have to take some vows.

280
00:17:18,535 --> 00:17:20,954
Okay, okay, listen.

281
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:24,207
Thank the girls for me,
tell them I had a wonderful time...

282
00:17:24,374 --> 00:17:27,085
...but tell them I have to pass
on the fealty stuff.

283
00:17:27,252 --> 00:17:30,631
I have a previous commitment to,
you know, God.

284
00:17:31,924 --> 00:17:33,675
It doesn't work that way, Charlie.

285
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:35,052
If you break your vows...

286
00:17:35,218 --> 00:17:38,347
...you bring down upon yourself
the ancient curse of betrayal.

287
00:17:38,513 --> 00:17:41,808
- Well, that's the chance I'll have to take.
- So be it.

288
00:17:41,975 --> 00:17:44,061
So be it.

289
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,400
Just kidding.

290
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:54,821
Simply out of curiosity,
what exactly is this curse?

291
00:17:54,988 --> 00:17:57,032
What should I be on the lookout for?

292
00:17:57,199 --> 00:18:00,869
- Your crops will wither in the field.
- Yeah, okay.

293
00:18:02,621 --> 00:18:05,624
Your cattle will sicken and die.

294
00:18:08,418 --> 00:18:12,923
Your manhood will shrivel
and become a useless husk.

295
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:17,386
I gotta fold here, Alan.

296
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:20,931
Okay, you got me.

297
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:24,768
What do you say we call the girls over
and start spawning baby Giglamesh... <i>(!? Gilgamesh)</i>

298
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:27,646
- Don't do this.
- Hey, when she's shriveling your husk...

299
00:18:27,813 --> 00:18:29,606
...then you get a vote.

300
00:18:31,817 --> 00:18:34,194
Go ahead, call the coven.

301
00:18:37,197 --> 00:18:40,909
Wow, you gals could make a fortune
delivering pizzas.

302
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:46,832
Mom?

303
00:18:47,457 --> 00:18:49,292
Boo, everybody.

304
00:18:53,046 --> 00:18:55,006
Now, not a word, Charlie.

305
00:18:55,173 --> 00:18:57,634
You're all coming with me
to my costume party...

306
00:18:57,801 --> 00:18:59,970
...and I'm not taking no for an answer.

307
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:01,972
Evelyn?

308
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:04,474
Isabella.

309
00:19:07,018 --> 00:19:09,312
You know each other?

310
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:11,815
In a manner of speaking.

311
00:19:15,068 --> 00:19:18,113
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.

312
00:19:18,697 --> 00:19:20,532
These are my sons.

313
00:19:23,743 --> 00:19:27,581
It was an accident. I had no idea.

314
00:19:27,747 --> 00:19:29,249
Please, believe me.

315
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,917
Goodbye, Isabella.

316
00:19:31,334 --> 00:19:32,919
Yes, goodbye.

317
00:19:35,463 --> 00:19:39,134
- Bye, Charlie.
- Hold on, hold on.

318
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:42,470
What about the vows,
the curse and the shriveling?

319
00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:45,473
I have no idea what he's talking about.

320
00:19:52,647 --> 00:19:54,941
What? She's in my Pilates class.

321
00:19:58,153 --> 00:19:59,779
- I'll buy that.
- Okay.

322
00:19:59,946 --> 00:20:03,825
Now, are you coming to my party
or you gonna give me a hard time?

323
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:09,789
- I'm coming to the party.
- Me too.

324
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:11,833
Jake, come get your costume.

325
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,336
- What's Mom gonna wear?
- Shut up.

326
00:20:19,757 --> 00:20:24,094
Let's go. Grand-mommy doesn't want
to be late to her costume party.

327
00:20:56,627 --> 00:21:00,547
Oh, come on, boys. Sell it.

328
00:21:12,476 --> 00:21:14,770
Very nice.

329
00:21:14,937 --> 00:21:18,565
Now fly, my pets, fly.

330
00:21:21,318 --> 00:21:23,445
I call shotgun.

331
