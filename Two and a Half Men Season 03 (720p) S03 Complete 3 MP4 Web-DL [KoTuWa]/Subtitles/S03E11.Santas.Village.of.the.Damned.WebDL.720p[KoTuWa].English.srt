Two and a Half Men S03E11 - Santa's Village of the Damned - Web-DL [KoTuWa]

1
00:00:11,427 --> 00:00:13,638
- Good morning.
- Morning.

2
00:00:13,804 --> 00:00:14,972
Charlie, right?

3
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:18,559
Well, I guess it's too late to deny it.

4
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:20,519
Would you like some coffee?

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,356
Sure...

6
00:00:24,982 --> 00:00:26,108
...I would.

7
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,363
You have a beautiful house.

8
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:34,200
Thank you...

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,955
...so much.

10
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,165
My name's Sandy.

11
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,627
Yes, of course it is.

12
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:51,884
How could I forget?
Sandy like the beach, or the Koufax.

13
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,929
- Pardon me?
- You know, Sandy Koufax.

14
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,640
Great Dodger pitcher,
hall-of-famer... Never mind.

15
00:00:58,849 --> 00:01:00,351
So, Sandy...

16
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,853
...how did you sleep?

17
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,356
Just fine. How about you?

18
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:08,567
Great. Like a drunk baby.

19
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:10,236
Are you hungry?

20
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,738
Not yet. Maybe after I throw up.

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,699
What did you do last night?

22
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:16,826
I was hoping you could fill me in.

23
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:20,579
There's my little Sandy beach.

24
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:23,666
Good morning, Alley-Oop.

25
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:27,837
Oh, thank God. I was afraid
I was gonna have to quit drinking.

26
00:01:37,346 --> 00:01:39,640
So, what do you think of Sandy?

27
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:43,436
Arguably the greatest southpaw
in the history of baseball.

28
00:01:44,353 --> 00:01:45,396
My Sandy.

29
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,315
I don't know,
I've never seen her pitch.

30
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:54,029
- But she sure can cook.
- Well, guess how we met.

31
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:57,158
I suppose we can rule out
Dodger Stadium.

32
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,411
In cooking class.

33
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,830
You've been taking a class?

34
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:07,251
- Where do you think I go every Tuesday?
- You're not here on Tuesday nights?

35
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:12,089
No, I'm in cooking class.
And guess who's the teacher?

36
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:14,675
- Who?
- Sandy.

37
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:17,845
Who's Sandy?

38
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,056
That's Sandy.

39
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,560
Great story.

40
00:02:25,644 --> 00:02:31,317
- Alan is my star pupil.
- And you are my star teacher.

41
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,153
So cute.

42
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:35,821
Yo.

43
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:41,660
- Can I have some more bacon?
- Oh, in a jiff.

44
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:46,832
My mother always said,
"A well-fed man is a happy man."

45
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:51,337
Our mother always said, "Here's
10 bucks for pizza, don't wait up."

46
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,383
Oh, that reminds me, she called
and invited us for Christmas.

47
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,511
- You told her yes, right?
- Absolutely.

48
00:02:58,677 --> 00:03:01,263
You and I were going
to spend Christmas together.

49
00:03:01,722 --> 00:03:03,098
We are.

50
00:03:03,265 --> 00:03:06,227
- But you're going to your mother's.
- What gave you that idea?

51
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,939
You see, Sandy,
it's kind of a family tradition.

52
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:13,275
Our mother invites us even though
she doesn't want us to come.

53
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:16,028
We say yes
even though we don't wanna go.

54
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,280
When we don't show,
though she's relieved...

55
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:21,867
...she gets to complain
about what horrible children she has.

56
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:24,453
It's the perfect gift.

57
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:28,916
Christmas is supposed to be about
spending time with your loved ones.

58
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,543
Yeah, going to our mother's
would cut into that.

59
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:37,091
Alan gets to spend it with his son and I
get to play Stuff the Stocking in Vegas...

60
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:40,344
...with a couple
of saline-enhanced elves.

61
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,973
Does this mean
that I'm finally going to meet your son?

62
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,225
I guess it does.

63
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,936
Gosh, I so hope he likes me.

64
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,729
The way you cook...

65
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:54,400
...the only problem is gonna be
keeping him from humping your leg.

66
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:57,903
That's the sheets.

67
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,740
If you fold them while they're warm,
they don't wrinkle.

68
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:07,746
Beauty, sex, cooking, laundry.

69
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:10,457
Marriage, boredom, alimony, death.

70
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,293
You are such a cynic.

71
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:15,462
- And you are such a sap.
- How am I a sap?

72
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:18,632
- Are you blind? She's a nester.
- What's that supposed to mean?

73
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,468
She throws you some tail,
a couple of pieces of bacon...

74
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:23,762
...and bibbidi-bobbidi-boo,
got a roommate.

75
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:27,766
"Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo"?
Isn't that from Cinderella?

76
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:30,060
You don't think
that bitch was a nester?

77
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,858
Anyway, I find that a couple of drops
of lemon juice on the dryer sheet...

78
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,068
...really freshens up the whole load.

79
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:41,280
Really? I find that just a couple Valiums
in my coffee...

80
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,657
...keeps me from snapping necks.

81
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,290
Well, hold this, please...

82
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:56,295
...I'm just going to pop these on the bed
while they're still warm and toasty.

83
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,676
So which one of you guys is slipping
the high hard one to Martha Stewart?

84
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:11,727
Hey, Brandi. It's Charlie Harper.

85
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,771
I'm coming to Vegas for Christmas...

86
00:05:13,937 --> 00:05:18,025
...and was wondering if you and your
sister wanted to celebrate again.

87
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,527
Harper.

88
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:27,367
Oh, wait, it's possible that you
remember me as Dr. Philip Gonzalez.

89
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:30,162
Right.

90
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:33,332
Yeah, hola.

91
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:39,046
Anyway, I'm sitting here making
vacation plans and I'm thinking:

92
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:43,509
"Where better to commemorate the birth
of our lord than Caesar's Palace?"

93
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,221
Hey, Charlie. Hungry?

94
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:48,555
Hold on, Brandi.

95
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:50,724
- Not really, but listen...
- Last chance.

96
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:53,852
I'm gonna start dinner
so the kitchen's gonna be off limits.

97
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:56,647
- But it's my kitchen.
- So?

98
00:05:57,147 --> 00:05:59,816
I just thought it was important
to point out.

99
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:02,110
You're so cute.

100
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:08,283
Look, Brandi, talk to your sister, work up
an estimate and I'll call you back.

101
00:06:10,744 --> 00:06:15,415
Oh, hi, Berta.
Oh, I've got a surprise for you.

102
00:06:15,582 --> 00:06:18,502
- A mini-blind brush.
- A what?

103
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:21,296
I don't think Alan's blinds
have been dusted.

104
00:06:21,463 --> 00:06:24,049
Probably because
you didn't have the proper tool.

105
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:26,718
Gee, thanks.

106
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:32,349
- We gotta talk.
- I'm on it.

107
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:34,851
You better be,
or else she's gonna be on it.

108
00:06:35,018 --> 00:06:37,646
Because now I have the proper tool.

109
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:43,652
- Hey, listen.
- You had your chance, Charlie.

110
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:47,823
- If you're hungry, take a pudding cup.
- I don't want a pudding cup.

111
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,244
- We need to establish ground rules.
- Oh, okay, I'm listening.

112
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,539
Okay, well, first of all,
Berta's been with me for a long time.

113
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,417
And what she lacks
in housekeeping skills...

114
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:02,129
...she more than makes up for
in upper-body strength.

115
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:05,173
What's that?

116
00:07:06,508 --> 00:07:08,677
- Rack of lamb.
- Really?

117
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:10,762
- You're making that for us?
- Yep.

118
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:14,266
With roasted baby potatoes
and caramelized carrots.

119
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:21,106
Anyway, anyway.

120
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:22,524
Ground rules.

121
00:07:22,691 --> 00:07:24,651
I wanna be supportive
of you and Alan...

122
00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:27,779
Sorry. One quick question.
Chocolate or raspberry soufflé?

123
00:07:27,946 --> 00:07:31,491
- It doesn't matter, the point is...
- I'll just make raspberry.

124
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,537
Actually, I prefer chocolate.

125
00:07:35,704 --> 00:07:38,081
Chocolate it is.

126
00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:40,542
Now, why don't I mix you up
a little cocktail...

127
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:44,671
- ...and you can take a nap before dinner?
- A nap would be nice.

128
00:07:46,923 --> 00:07:48,550
Can I still have the pudding cup?

129
00:07:50,385 --> 00:07:53,096
Okay, but just one.

130
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:55,891
I don't want you spoiling your appetite
before dinner.

131
00:07:57,726 --> 00:07:59,227
Thank you.

132
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:02,147
Go on.

133
00:08:03,523 --> 00:08:05,067
- Well?
- Good news.

134
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:06,818
We're having rack of lamb.

135
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:20,248
Oh, no.

136
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:28,673
I'm hungry. Where's Sandy?

137
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,885
She went to get a honey-baked ham
for Christmas Eve dinner.

138
00:08:32,052 --> 00:08:34,513
Honey-baked ham.

139
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:39,601
I find it a little ironic that despite your
warnings about her nesting instincts...

140
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:42,103
...you haven't missed a single one
of her meals.

141
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,940
Yeah, I'm a master of irony.

142
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:48,735
- I thought you were going to Vegas.
- Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

143
00:08:49,277 --> 00:08:51,696
Then you'd have the whole ham
to yourself.

144
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:55,283
You should talk, Porky.

145
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,244
Who took the lasagna
under the deck...

146
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,663
...so we wouldn't see him eat it
all himself?

147
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,833
Who made a meatloaf sandwich
by taking a slice of meatloaf...

148
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:05,836
...and putting it between
two other slices of meatloaf?

149
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:11,091
I am cutting down on carbs.

150
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:13,510
Yeah, it's working for you.

151
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:19,307
When's the last time you looked down
in the shower and saw your testicles?

152
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:23,353
I don't need to see them.
I know they're there.

153
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,731
And what about you?
What do you call this?

154
00:09:26,898 --> 00:09:28,483
Goodyear or Pirelli?

155
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,987
This, my chunky friend,
is water weight.

156
00:09:32,153 --> 00:09:33,780
Water weight.

157
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:35,699
It's genetic. I retain water.

158
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:40,912
You also retain German chocolate cake,
lamb stew and Belgian waffles.

159
00:09:43,873 --> 00:09:49,296
Hey, people who live in fat asses
shouldn't throw waffles.

160
00:09:49,462 --> 00:09:51,339
Don't talk about my ass.

161
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:53,633
I am very self-conscious about my ass.

162
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,552
I'm... I'm sorry.

163
00:09:55,719 --> 00:10:01,141
I'm just lashing out
because I haven't eaten in 75 minutes.

164
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:03,059
Want some of Sandy's
homemade fudge?

165
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:05,770
Don't play with me, Alan.

166
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,400
- You've got fudge up here?
- Close your eyes.

167
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:20,952
Okay.

168
00:10:22,245 --> 00:10:23,496
Fudge.

169
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:27,709
You know what would be great?

170
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:30,462
Honey-baked fudge.

171
00:10:31,421 --> 00:10:33,089
Or...

172
00:10:33,256 --> 00:10:34,799
...fudge-covered ham.

173
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:43,767
Well, I'm really happy we get
to spend Christmas together.

174
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:46,102
We don't have to go
to your mom's, do we?

175
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:48,438
Don't be silly.

176
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:50,857
Hey, you hungry?

177
00:10:51,024 --> 00:10:54,944
- I could eat.
- Well, you're gonna.

178
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:57,280
Can we order Chinese
like we did last year?

179
00:10:57,447 --> 00:11:00,617
No, this year we're gonna
do something a little more traditional.

180
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:02,869
Deli?

181
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:06,790
No, we're gonna have a real,
home-cooked Christmas dinner.

182
00:11:06,956 --> 00:11:09,167
Whose home?

183
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:12,462
- Our home.
- How?

184
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:17,759
Well, I am dating a lady who's
gonna make us a wonderful dinner.

185
00:11:18,218 --> 00:11:19,427
Oh, okay.

186
00:11:20,637 --> 00:11:22,472
Are you at all curious?

187
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,265
Yeah, a little.

188
00:11:24,432 --> 00:11:27,936
Okay, you can ask me any question
and I'll try and answer it for you.

189
00:11:28,603 --> 00:11:30,313
What are we having?

190
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,232
No, about the lady.

191
00:11:33,316 --> 00:11:34,984
No, not really.

192
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:37,946
Well, I just want you to know
that I really like her...

193
00:11:38,113 --> 00:11:40,949
...and you're probably gonna
be seeing her a lot.

194
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:42,826
Do I have to like her?

195
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:47,080
- Well, of course not.
- Then I probably won't.

196
00:11:47,664 --> 00:11:49,124
Why would you say that?

197
00:11:49,624 --> 00:11:52,627
We're very different people, Dad.

198
00:11:54,003 --> 00:11:55,797
So true.

199
00:11:55,964 --> 00:11:58,758
Is she gonna be staying over?

200
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:02,428
- Yes.
- Where is she gonna sleep?

201
00:12:02,595 --> 00:12:03,763
In my room.

202
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:06,099
Okay.

203
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:10,061
Just remember, the walls are thin
and I'm impressionable.

204
00:12:19,195 --> 00:12:20,947
Hey, what are you doing out here?

205
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:23,366
I thought I should prepare you.

206
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:24,868
For what?

207
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,537
Alan.

208
00:12:28,788 --> 00:12:30,623
Remember what I told you
about nesters?

209
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,083
Yeah.

210
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,087
Well, some are hummingbirds,
some are robins.

211
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:38,923
But you, my friend...

212
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,894
...you've got yourself a partridge
in a freaking pear tree.

213
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:59,444
- Sandy did all this?
- Yep.

214
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:02,405
I think it's cool.
It's like an amusement park.

215
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:06,326
Yeah, Six Flags
Over Crazy-Ass-Chick Land.

216
00:13:07,118 --> 00:13:09,370
This cannot be Jake.

217
00:13:09,537 --> 00:13:11,247
You're too grown-up-looking.

218
00:13:11,414 --> 00:13:13,458
Yeah, thanks.
Are those for anybody?

219
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,043
Help yourselves.

220
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:21,382
Gingerbread.

221
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:23,635
Jake, you can help me
in the kitchen.

222
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:26,929
I'm making chocolate éclairs
and I need an official taster.

223
00:13:27,096 --> 00:13:28,222
I like her.

224
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:35,355
Will you look at that?
They're bonding already.

225
00:13:35,521 --> 00:13:39,233
Alan, your kid would join the Taliban aliban
if they made their own s'mores.

226
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:44,405
- So when did she do all this decorating?
- Hard to say.

227
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:48,910
- Everything was normal until lunchtime.
- Oh, I missed lunch.

228
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:50,119
What did you have?

229
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:54,499
She made me a bacon, lettuce
and tomato sandwich...

230
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:57,460
...with garlic mayonnaise
on sourdough toast.

231
00:13:57,627 --> 00:14:00,630
Oh, damn.

232
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,424
Anyway, after lunch I took
a little nap...

233
00:14:03,591 --> 00:14:07,804
...and woke up
in Santa's Village of the Damned.

234
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:10,098
Why do you have to be so cynical?

235
00:14:10,264 --> 00:14:15,853
There is nothing wrong with decorating
your home to show a little holiday spirit.

236
00:14:16,229 --> 00:14:17,855
But it's not her home, is it?

237
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:19,482
Well, no.

238
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:23,486
- Whose home is it, Alan?
- Okay, fine, I will have a talk with her.

239
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:25,613
- Hold it.
- What?

240
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,907
After dinner, you nimrod.

241
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:37,500
Anybody have room for another éclair?

242
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,544
Not unless I unbutton my pants.

243
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,963
Mine are already unbuttoned.

244
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:46,134
I took mine off when she brought out
the marshmallow yams.

245
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,220
Okay, then. What do you say
we all go into the living room...

246
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:51,139
...and sing some Christmas carols?

247
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:55,059
- You mean stand up?
- I don't think I can.

248
00:14:55,226 --> 00:14:57,645
I'm not wearing pants.

249
00:14:57,812 --> 00:15:00,690
Come on, you guys,
what's Christmas without caroling?

250
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:03,276
Hanukkah?

251
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,585
Sandy? Something wrong?

252
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:22,169
Who moved the reindeer?

253
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:25,381
I don't know that one, but I'll wing it.

254
00:15:25,548 --> 00:15:29,760
Who moved the reindeer?
The savior's come

255
00:15:29,927 --> 00:15:32,972
He's coming to check on the rein...

256
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:35,308
No, no, no.

257
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:39,562
- These reindeer.
- What about them?

258
00:15:40,104 --> 00:15:42,148
Donner and Blitzen are out of order.

259
00:15:42,315 --> 00:15:44,567
- Somebody's been playing with them.
- So?

260
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:46,527
So I wanna know who it was.

261
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:49,697
- Jake?
- I didn't do it.

262
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:50,907
Charlie?

263
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:56,287
Oh, all right, I may have used one
of them as a swizzle stick.

264
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,207
Well, no harm done.

265
00:16:00,374 --> 00:16:02,543
If you must play with them,
please remember...

266
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:06,213
...it's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen,
Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen.

267
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,590
Okay.

268
00:16:07,757 --> 00:16:10,176
Donner, Blitzen, Donner, Blitzen,
Donner, Blitzen.

269
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:12,678
- Got it.
- Say it.

270
00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:15,431
Donner, Blitzen.

271
00:16:17,725 --> 00:16:19,393
Okay, then.

272
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,146
"The Little Drummer Boy."

273
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:57,890
Donner, Blitzen, Donner, Blitzen.

274
00:16:59,475 --> 00:17:02,019
Alan. Why aren't you asleep?

275
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:04,105
I don't know.

276
00:17:04,271 --> 00:17:07,775
Just excited about Christmas, I guess.

277
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:11,028
Well, Santa won't come
while you're awake.

278
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:14,407
Yeah. Yeah, I've heard that.

279
00:17:14,907 --> 00:17:17,576
Now close your eyes
and let visions of sugarplums...

280
00:17:17,743 --> 00:17:20,538
...dance through your wee little head.

281
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:22,665
Okay.

282
00:17:26,043 --> 00:17:28,421
- Oh, no.
- What?

283
00:17:28,587 --> 00:17:32,466
I forgot to put out cookies
and milk for Santa.

284
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:35,594
You're kidding, right?

285
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:37,471
Do you want coal in your stocking?

286
00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:42,017
That's what you're gonna get if Santa
doesn't find a snack when he comes.

287
00:17:42,184 --> 00:17:44,228
I see.

288
00:17:44,395 --> 00:17:48,649
So you believe in the vengeful,
Old Testament Santa.

289
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,901
Are you mocking Christmas?

290
00:17:51,068 --> 00:17:52,945
No, no, no. You know what?

291
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:57,366
I'll take care of the milk and cookies.
You just relax and go to sleep.

292
00:17:59,368 --> 00:18:02,663
He sees us when we're sleeping,
you know?

293
00:18:03,873 --> 00:18:04,915
Right.

294
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,002
I don't make the rules.

295
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,088
Okay.

296
00:18:15,342 --> 00:18:18,846
Oh, God, oh, God

297
00:18:19,013 --> 00:18:22,808
Oh, God, oh, God

298
00:18:23,684 --> 00:18:25,728
- Charlie?
- Hang on.

299
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:34,528
Okay, I'm ready for more pie.

300
00:18:35,112 --> 00:18:36,989
We have a serious problem here.

301
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:38,866
We're out of pie?

302
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:41,577
Will you listen?
There's something wrong with Sandy.

303
00:18:41,744 --> 00:18:44,872
Well, didn't we know that
when she agreed to sleep with you?

304
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,168
No, no, even wronger than that.
She actually believes in Santa Claus.

305
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:50,836
- Really?
- Yeah.

306
00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:53,923
But we still have pie?

307
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:58,427
- Yes, we still have pie.
- Then what are we doing up here?

308
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:02,681
I guess I could have a little sliver.

309
00:19:19,073 --> 00:19:20,824
You know what?

310
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:23,869
I think something's wrong with Sandy.

311
00:19:24,578 --> 00:19:28,165
I just said that.
Do you ever listen to me?

312
00:19:29,249 --> 00:19:31,794
Sandy, sweetheart?

313
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,547
- You okay?
- He's not coming.

314
00:19:35,714 --> 00:19:38,175
Who's not coming? Listen to this.

315
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:40,344
Santa.

316
00:19:43,013 --> 00:19:45,974
Every year,
I try to make things perfect.

317
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:49,770
And every year I fail.

318
00:19:49,937 --> 00:19:52,022
Mama was right.

319
00:19:52,189 --> 00:19:54,942
I am a naughty girl.

320
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,904
Come on, Alan.

321
00:19:59,071 --> 00:20:00,406
Where are we going?

322
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:04,660
I want you to teach this naughty girl
a lesson.

323
00:20:04,827 --> 00:20:06,704
She needs to be punished.

324
00:20:09,832 --> 00:20:12,334
You lucky dog.

325
00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:15,546
What? I'm not going in there.
She's nuts.

326
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:19,174
Yeah, so?
Sex with crazy chicks is great.

327
00:20:19,341 --> 00:20:22,803
Make sure you pick positions where
you can see what her hands are doing.

328
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,013
No. No, that would be
taking advantage...

329
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,224
...of a mentally unbalanced person.

330
00:20:27,391 --> 00:20:30,060
Oh, Alan, that boat has sailed.

331
00:20:30,227 --> 00:20:33,689
You might as well hop on board
for a farewell cruise.

332
00:20:33,856 --> 00:20:36,316
I don't think so.
It just wouldn't be right.

333
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:40,237
Come on, Alan, I'm ready.

334
00:20:47,244 --> 00:20:49,496
Good night.

335
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:59,047
Okay, pie for everybody.

336
00:21:03,677 --> 00:21:05,345
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

337
00:21:06,096 --> 00:21:07,723
Are you out of your mind?

338
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:10,934
You've been nagging us for years
to spend Christmas with you.

339
00:21:11,101 --> 00:21:13,312
Only because I knew
you'd never show up.

340
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:15,814
Well, we had to get out of the house.

341
00:21:15,981 --> 00:21:18,275
Yeah, the walls are thin
and I'm impressionable.

342
00:21:19,735 --> 00:21:24,698
Hold on. Stanley, put your pants on.
We'll exchange gifts later.

343
00:21:25,866 --> 00:21:26,909
Come on in.

344
00:21:29,494 --> 00:21:33,498
Dear God, look at the size of your ass.

345
