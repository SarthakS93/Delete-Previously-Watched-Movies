Two and a Half Men S03E08 - That Voodoo That I Do Do - Web-DL [KoTuWa]

2
00:00:02,376 --> 00:00:04,128
Thank you.

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:09,008
Oh, I knew it.
There's no extra foam in my latte.

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,343
You ask for extra foam...

5
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:13,846
...you might as well be asking for
a piggyback ride, know what I mean?

6
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,556
Charlie?

7
00:00:15,723 --> 00:00:17,266
Charlie?

8
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:19,769
Oh, of course.

9
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,688
Man's got a heat-seeking missile
in his pants.

10
00:00:24,148 --> 00:00:26,776
Is it too much to ask that
when we go out for coffee...

11
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:31,155
...you stay within earshot, so I'm not
talking to myself like a crazy person?

12
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:34,784
And again, I'm talking to myself
like a crazy person.

13
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:36,369
Look.

14
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,081
Yes, I see.

15
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,750
Girl pretty. Charlie like.

16
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:45,461
No, girl magnificent.

17
00:00:46,128 --> 00:00:47,546
Charlie buy her Lexus.

18
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:52,051
I thought we were gonna
hang out together...

19
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,262
...but obviously your neurotic need
for sex is more important...

20
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:57,640
...than spending time
with your only brother...

21
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:01,143
...who despite everything continues
to love you and is, by the way...

22
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,688
...your best hope for
a viable kidney transplant.

23
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,026
You can get yourself home, right?

24
00:01:11,737 --> 00:01:14,031
What makes you think
that she's even available?

25
00:01:14,198 --> 00:01:17,493
Maybe she's married, maybe she's gay,
maybe she's a guy.

26
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:22,164
Hey, I don't see a ring,
a girlfriend or a bulge.

27
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:26,210
If you'll excuse me, it's time to do
that voodoo that I do do so well.

28
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,464
Hi.

29
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,927
- I'm Charlie.
- Don't care.

30
00:01:35,511 --> 00:01:38,347
- And you are?
- Not interested.

31
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,641
How do you know?

32
00:01:42,184 --> 00:01:43,686
I know.

33
00:01:45,896 --> 00:01:47,606
Okay then.

34
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,572
You think it's over?
Because it's not over.

35
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:56,115
Oh, I'm sorry.

36
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:00,035
I guess I was mislead by her complete
and utter indifference to you.

37
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,538
Yeah, well, watch and learn.

38
00:02:03,914 --> 00:02:06,041
- So...
- Go away.

39
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:10,755
How about now? Is it over now?

40
00:02:12,047 --> 00:02:13,841
It's not an exact science, Alan.

41
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:20,389
Look, if you knew me at all and shut
me down, that would be one thing...

42
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:25,436
...but to be dismissed on a simple hello,
well, that's a tough pill to swallow.

43
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:28,731
Would you rather I give it to you
in a suppository?

44
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:32,860
- Well, to be perfectly honest...
- Goodbye.

45
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:38,032
- Hey, hey, did you hear that?
- What?

46
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,867
It's a... It's a fat lady...

47
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,994
...and she's singing.

48
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:48,167
- You'd give up right now, wouldn't you?
- Charlie, Elvis has left the building.

49
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,378
I think giving up is
a little moot at this point.

50
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:53,714
Well, that attitude
is why you sleep alone...

51
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:57,468
...with a copy of Monster Boobs
magazine under your pillow.

52
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:01,764
Stay out of my room.

53
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:32,903
Waverly Dance Studio,
3737 Waverly Street.

54
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,112
Got it.

55
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:38,241
Westwood Academy of Dance,
14001 Pico Boulevard.

56
00:03:39,034 --> 00:03:40,077
What's going on?

57
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:42,120
I'm mapping out
all the dance studios...

58
00:03:42,287 --> 00:03:44,414
- ...within a five-mile radius.
- Why?

59
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:47,918
I can't stop thinking about
that girl I met. I have to find her.

60
00:03:48,418 --> 00:03:51,505
Shame you can't let your penis
sniff a piece of her clothing.

61
00:03:51,672 --> 00:03:55,300
Look, I know her name, Mia.
It was written on her coffee cup.

62
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:56,510
I know she's a dancer.

63
00:03:56,677 --> 00:03:59,805
She was wearing leg-warmer-thingies
and reading a dance magazine.

64
00:03:59,971 --> 00:04:02,599
Reading a dance magazine
doesn't make you a dancer.

65
00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:04,601
Why not? You're a monster boob.

66
00:04:07,437 --> 00:04:09,439
Will you both stay out of my room.

67
00:04:11,191 --> 00:04:13,944
Tell me, why do you want to
go to all this trouble...

68
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:17,155
...to track down a girl who showed
less than no interest in you?

69
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:20,659
A girl who seemed actually repulsed
by your very being.

70
00:04:20,826 --> 00:04:24,746
A girl whose skin visibly crawled
at your mere proximity.

71
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:27,040
Yeah, but did you see her butt?

72
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,794
It was like a ripe little peach.

73
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:34,673
That's your answer?
Her ass reminded you of fruit?

74
00:04:35,465 --> 00:04:37,134
Berta, explain it to him.

75
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,387
A lot of the times a peach
will have a subtle cleft in it...

76
00:04:40,554 --> 00:04:43,181
- ...that is reminiscent of a woman's...
- No. Thanks.

77
00:04:43,348 --> 00:04:45,308
Thanks, I got the picture.

78
00:04:45,475 --> 00:04:49,146
Alan, do you know why Sir Edmund
Hillary wanted to scale Mount Everest?

79
00:04:50,147 --> 00:04:53,108
Because it reminded him
of a big pointy melon?

80
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,736
That's part of the reason,
but the main reason was...

81
00:04:56,903 --> 00:05:00,031
...he wanted to do it because
everyone thought it was impossible.

82
00:05:00,574 --> 00:05:02,200
I'm missing the connection here.

83
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:04,369
If a girl like Mia were easy to climb...

84
00:05:04,578 --> 00:05:06,746
...her head would be
covered with flags.

85
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:09,499
- So you're looking for a challenge.
- Exactly.

86
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,502
No one takes a picture of the fish
that jumps on your boat.

87
00:05:13,044 --> 00:05:15,881
I... I'm confused.
Is she a mountain or a fish?

88
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:18,508
Doesn't matter,
either way I'm gonna scale her.

89
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:24,097
And you,
why do you enable this behavior?

90
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,350
Why? I'll tell you why.

91
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:31,229
Because your brother is the embodiment
of the roll-up-your-sleeves spirit...

92
00:05:31,396 --> 00:05:32,939
...that made this country great.

93
00:05:33,106 --> 00:05:35,859
He never gets discouraged,
he goes after what he wants...

94
00:05:36,026 --> 00:05:38,028
...and he doesn't know
the meaning of quit.

95
00:05:38,195 --> 00:05:41,448
If the day should come when any man,
no matter how humble...

96
00:05:41,615 --> 00:05:44,951
...can't go out there and soil the loins
of some hot little dancer...

97
00:05:45,118 --> 00:05:48,121
...well, I don't wanna live
in that America.

98
00:06:01,217 --> 00:06:03,762
Okay, very good. Now reverse.

99
00:06:08,642 --> 00:06:10,268
Oh, leave me alone.

100
00:06:10,477 --> 00:06:11,603
Keep going.

101
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,146
Hey, you're a teacher.

102
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:15,065
Hey, you're a stalker.

103
00:06:15,273 --> 00:06:18,360
No, no. I was passing by
and happened to look in the window.

104
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:19,653
What's the map for?

105
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:22,697
Oh, this? I had to go to
eight other dance studios...

106
00:06:22,864 --> 00:06:24,908
...before I found the right window.

107
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:28,870
I suppose that could be
interpreted as stalking...

108
00:06:29,037 --> 00:06:32,791
...but it could be just as easily be seen
as sincerity, persistence...

109
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,709
Mental illness?

110
00:06:35,251 --> 00:06:37,629
Come on, I'm clearly smitten.
Throw me a bone.

111
00:06:37,837 --> 00:06:40,131
- Charlie...
- You remembered my name.

112
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,510
I wrote it down
in case I needed to call the cops.

113
00:06:43,718 --> 00:06:47,722
I don't have time for dating right now.
I'm completely focused on my work.

114
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:51,142
Well, let's talk about work.
I've always wanted to learn to dance...

115
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:54,104
- ...can you teach me?
- I only teach children.

116
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,649
You don't have a class full of
large, slow kids I could be part of?

117
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,196
All right, how about this.

118
00:07:03,363 --> 00:07:04,656
My nephew loves to dance.

119
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:08,201
A gifted little boy.
Moves like a gazelle.

120
00:07:08,743 --> 00:07:11,413
- How old is he?
- I don't know, 11, 12.

121
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:13,832
It's hard to say, he's got a big head.

122
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,626
Frankly I'd love to have
a boy in the class.

123
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,878
It's hard to get males
excited about ballet.

124
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:23,466
Jake is just ballet this and ballet that.

125
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:25,927
Yeah, I'm sure.

126
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:28,596
Why don't you bring him
by tomorrow?

127
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:32,392
- Great. Maybe afterwards you and l...
- Charlie, listen carefully.

128
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:35,478
You and I, never gonna happen.

129
00:07:36,104 --> 00:07:38,064
Understood. See you tomorrow.

130
00:07:42,152 --> 00:07:45,071
Charlie to base camp,
I am beginning my ascent.

131
00:07:50,618 --> 00:07:54,205
How you liking the pizza your old
Uncle Charlie bought for his buddy?

132
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:55,415
It's good.

133
00:07:55,623 --> 00:07:58,793
Save room, I've got a half-gallon of that
fudge brownie ice cream.

134
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,712
I don't know, I'm pretty stuffed.

135
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,424
- You sure?
- Maybe after I poop.

136
00:08:05,675 --> 00:08:06,718
What are you doing?

137
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:09,929
- We're eating dinner.
- He had dinner an hour ago.

138
00:08:10,138 --> 00:08:13,433
- Well, then he won't need breakfast.
- Yes, I will.

139
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:17,103
You've had enough to eat.

140
00:08:17,353 --> 00:08:20,190
Hey, Jake, you know what I like to do
after a nice big meal?

141
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:22,192
- What?
- Learn to dance.

142
00:08:25,987 --> 00:08:27,030
- Charlie.
- Yeah?

143
00:08:27,197 --> 00:08:28,907
Private word.

144
00:08:29,282 --> 00:08:30,825
Sure.

145
00:08:34,287 --> 00:08:36,039
- What's up?
- Shame on you.

146
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:37,874
Is that it?

147
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,459
You found that girl...

148
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:42,253
...and now you have a plan
to use my son as bait.

149
00:08:42,462 --> 00:08:46,090
Yeah, so? It's not like he pays rent.
Why shouldn't he pitch in a little?

150
00:08:46,883 --> 00:08:47,926
I will not allow it.

151
00:08:48,426 --> 00:08:50,678
Come on, it's just a couple
of ballet lessons.

152
00:08:50,887 --> 00:08:52,805
Ballet? Him?

153
00:08:53,348 --> 00:08:56,059
I think he has a quiet grace about him.

154
00:08:57,977 --> 00:09:00,480
He doesn't have to be good,
he just has to show up.

155
00:09:00,647 --> 00:09:02,065
One lesson, I'm begging you.

156
00:09:02,232 --> 00:09:04,651
You know what,
it really doesn't matter what I say.

157
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:06,903
You will never convince him
to take ballet.

158
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:08,988
If I can, will you stay out of it?

159
00:09:09,197 --> 00:09:10,782
- I guess.
- Great.

160
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:12,533
Hey, Jake.

161
00:09:13,743 --> 00:09:16,621
Okay, that might have been
bad parenting on my part.

162
00:09:17,205 --> 00:09:18,581
I've got a surprise for you.

163
00:09:19,415 --> 00:09:20,708
It's not more food, is it?

164
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,378
Because I'm starting to feel
a little dizzy.

165
00:09:23,586 --> 00:09:27,131
You're gonna get to do something
that no other boy in your class has done.

166
00:09:27,298 --> 00:09:31,094
If it's sex, Mitchell Fineman
already saw his cousin naked.

167
00:09:31,302 --> 00:09:33,388
- No, this is better than sex.
- What?

168
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:35,765
How would he know?

169
00:09:36,516 --> 00:09:39,978
- You're gonna learn to dance ballet.
- Wanna bet?

170
00:09:42,939 --> 00:09:44,941
Okay, let me put it this way.

171
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:49,070
How much money would I have to give
you to take ballet lessons?

172
00:09:49,404 --> 00:09:52,365
- I want $10.
- Wait, hold on.

173
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:00,039
I want $1000.

174
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,253
That's really unethical.

175
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:08,297
Oh, yeah, I'm the one
on shaky moral ground.

176
00:10:10,007 --> 00:10:13,302
- Okay, I'll give you $500.
- Split the difference.

177
00:10:13,511 --> 00:10:15,221
- Two-fifty.
- Done.

178
00:10:26,274 --> 00:10:27,775
Come on, let's go.

179
00:10:27,942 --> 00:10:29,444
I changed my mind.

180
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,738
You took my money.

181
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,115
I'll give it back.

182
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:36,576
Jake, we're here.
You may as well give it a try.

183
00:10:36,743 --> 00:10:40,413
Yeah, give it a try.
Who knows, you might like it.

184
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:50,256
I will never forgive you for this.

185
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:01,392
You didn't tell me
I'd be the only boy here.

186
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,894
So? The odds are on your side.

187
00:11:04,436 --> 00:11:07,106
The odds for what? I'm 11.

188
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:10,693
- I wanna go home.
- I thought we had a deal.

189
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:13,070
You can't make him stay
if he doesn't want to.

190
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:15,447
I love you, Dad.

191
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:18,826
All right, let's get started.

192
00:11:19,743 --> 00:11:22,037
- Who's that?
- Your teacher.

193
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:24,331
- Come on, let's go.
- Hang on, Dad.

194
00:11:24,498 --> 00:11:26,458
Maybe we should give this a chance.

195
00:11:28,002 --> 00:11:29,128
Hi, I'm Jake.

196
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,465
- Hi, Jake. It's nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

197
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:38,137
- Your uncle tells me you like ballet.
- Yeah.

198
00:11:39,096 --> 00:11:41,223
Okay. How about you
line up with the girls...

199
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,767
- ...and we'll get started.
- Yeah.

200
00:11:44,351 --> 00:11:45,811
How about that?

201
00:11:45,978 --> 00:11:47,938
He's got a crush.

202
00:11:48,105 --> 00:11:50,274
It's like watching a dog chase a car.

203
00:11:50,441 --> 00:11:54,278
He'll never catch it, and even if he did,
he couldn't drive it.

204
00:11:55,571 --> 00:11:58,157
He's still doing better than you.

205
00:11:59,783 --> 00:12:02,369
Everyone, I'd like you to meet
our new student Jake.

206
00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:06,081
- Hi, Jake.
- Yeah, hi.

207
00:12:07,332 --> 00:12:11,003
Okay, let's start in first position.
Jake, do you know first position?

208
00:12:11,545 --> 00:12:13,964
Is that like the missionary position?

209
00:12:18,552 --> 00:12:21,221
And one, and two...

210
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:24,933
...and three, and four.

211
00:12:28,562 --> 00:12:31,023
I will never forgive you for this.

212
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,650
What? He's having a great time.

213
00:12:33,817 --> 00:12:36,153
The clueless knucklehead.

214
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,947
Okay, very nice, class.

215
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:41,325
Yeah, good hustle, everybody.

216
00:12:42,117 --> 00:12:43,202
Much better, Jake.

217
00:12:43,744 --> 00:12:46,914
- That's because I have a good teacher.
- Thank you.

218
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,749
All right, that's it for this week.

219
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,168
Remember, life is a dance,
live it gracefully.

220
00:12:51,376 --> 00:12:52,753
That's my motto.

221
00:12:58,425 --> 00:12:59,718
Well, that settles it.

222
00:12:59,885 --> 00:13:02,012
I wanna be a ballet dancer
when I grow up.

223
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:05,224
Really? There's a load off my mind.

224
00:13:05,432 --> 00:13:07,935
It's not as easy as it looks.
It's pretty hard.

225
00:13:08,143 --> 00:13:10,270
Yeah. It's pretty hard to watch.

226
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,856
Thanks.

227
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:16,777
Did you see how far Mia
could put her leg over her head?

228
00:13:16,944 --> 00:13:19,321
I did notice that, yes.

229
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,534
So, what do you think,
Fred Astaire or Fred Flintstone?

230
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,620
- He's got a lot of enthusiasm.
- He gets that from me.

231
00:13:26,828 --> 00:13:28,205
I thought you were his uncle.

232
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:31,041
That's the whole
nature and nurture debate, isn't it?

233
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,585
- So listen, Mia...
- I'm not going out with you.

234
00:13:34,127 --> 00:13:35,921
I know, you made it very clear.

235
00:13:36,088 --> 00:13:39,216
My question was is there anything more
we can do to help Jake?

236
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,385
Extra classes? Private tutoring?

237
00:13:41,551 --> 00:13:44,012
The three of us in Cabo
for a long weekend?

238
00:13:45,305 --> 00:13:49,059
If he comes to class regularly,
I think you'll be amazed at his progress.

239
00:13:49,268 --> 00:13:51,645
Good, I'd hate to think he's peaked.

240
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:53,605
We're having a recital next month...

241
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:56,858
...and with a lot of work and
a little luck, we can include him.

242
00:13:59,528 --> 00:14:01,071
Charlie to base camp...

243
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:04,032
...pretty cold up here, visibility zero.

244
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:07,364
Call me.

245
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,534
Okay.

246
00:16:21,795 --> 00:16:23,046
I hope you like this.

247
00:16:23,213 --> 00:16:26,341
It's an impertinent little Cabernet
with oaky overtones...

248
00:16:26,508 --> 00:16:28,843
...and just the hint of a floral finish.

249
00:16:29,386 --> 00:16:33,306
- Wow, you really know your wines.
- I just read it off the box.

250
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:37,269
What's the plan? Get me drunk
and take advantage of me?

251
00:16:37,477 --> 00:16:39,437
Oh, good, you've done this before.

252
00:16:44,651 --> 00:16:46,319
I had a very nice time tonight.

253
00:16:46,903 --> 00:16:49,406
Was it worth all the trouble
I put you through?

254
00:16:50,073 --> 00:16:51,283
You tell me.

255
00:16:51,825 --> 00:16:53,618
Ask me again in the morning.

256
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,038
Charlie to base camp.

257
00:16:57,205 --> 00:16:59,165
I can see the summit.

258
00:17:03,295 --> 00:17:06,172
- Hey.
- Hey, Jake.

259
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:09,217
- What are you doing up?
- Why shouldn't I be up?

260
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,303
Isn't it past your bedtime?

261
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:13,722
I don't know
what you're talking about.

262
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:17,434
- I don't have a bedtime.
- Okay.

263
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,311
- So, what's going on?
- Not too much.

264
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:21,146
Where's your dad?

265
00:17:21,688 --> 00:17:24,441
I don't know,
why don't you go look for him?

266
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:28,653
Look, Jake, Mia and I
are kind of busy right now.

267
00:17:29,321 --> 00:17:31,239
- Busy doing what?
- Talking.

268
00:17:31,781 --> 00:17:35,035
Okay. What are we talking about?

269
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,163
We are not talking about anything.
You're going to bed.

270
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,373
Why don't we let Mia decide?

271
00:17:41,082 --> 00:17:43,126
Jake, I think you should go to bed.

272
00:17:43,335 --> 00:17:46,296
Are you sure?
You don't have to decide right now.

273
00:17:47,088 --> 00:17:50,425
Your uncle and I would like to spend
some alone-time together.

274
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:53,928
All right.

275
00:17:55,138 --> 00:17:56,765
You want me to tuck you in?

276
00:17:57,307 --> 00:18:01,102
I'm too old to get tucked in, you...
You ass-face.

277
00:18:02,687 --> 00:18:06,316
Okay, then, sleep tight, little camper.

278
00:18:09,694 --> 00:18:11,029
Kids, huh?

279
00:18:11,196 --> 00:18:13,323
Yeah, kids.

280
00:18:14,032 --> 00:18:16,910
He never called me
an ass-face before.

281
00:18:17,452 --> 00:18:20,789
- I think he's a little jealous.
- Yeah.

282
00:18:21,706 --> 00:18:23,208
I remember feeling like that...

283
00:18:23,374 --> 00:18:24,876
- ...when I was his age.
- Really?

284
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:27,462
Cafeteria lady.

285
00:18:28,797 --> 00:18:30,673
Looked like Valerie Bertinelli...

286
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,178
...but, you know, with a hairnet and
just the cutest whisper of a mustache.

287
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:38,556
She didn't know I was alive.

288
00:18:38,723 --> 00:18:40,058
You poor thing.

289
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,270
I'm sorry, Mia. I can't...
I can't do this to him.

290
00:18:44,813 --> 00:18:46,147
Do what to him?

291
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:49,317
One afternoon I saw the cafeteria lady
holding hands...

292
00:18:49,484 --> 00:18:51,653
...with the shop teacher
in the parking lot...

293
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,655
...and it just killed me.

294
00:18:53,822 --> 00:18:57,033
Mr. Dinapoli. I'll never forget it.

295
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,161
She was holding the hand
with the missing thumb.

296
00:19:03,164 --> 00:19:05,959
You know what,
I've gotta take you home.

297
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,752
- I understand.
- You do?

298
00:19:07,961 --> 00:19:09,379
You love Jake.

299
00:19:09,546 --> 00:19:12,882
You'd rather give up spending the night
with me than risk hurting him.

300
00:19:13,091 --> 00:19:14,551
Right.

301
00:19:14,926 --> 00:19:18,471
Although when you spell it out like that,
it sounds incredibly stupid.

302
00:19:19,556 --> 00:19:21,099
You're a very sweet man.

303
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:22,433
Thank you.

304
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:32,694
I was kidding. Let's go upstairs.

305
00:19:33,403 --> 00:19:35,697
Charlie, take me home.

306
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:39,117
Let's talk about this.
He's 11, he'll get over it.

307
00:19:39,284 --> 00:19:41,995
I got over one-thumb Dinapoli.

308
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,962
You asleep?

309
00:19:55,174 --> 00:19:58,761
- You can quit faking, I took her home.
- Really?

310
00:20:00,137 --> 00:20:01,931
- Yeah.
- How come?

311
00:20:02,473 --> 00:20:04,391
It's part of the guy code.

312
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:08,229
When two friends like the same girl,
one of them has to step aside.

313
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:13,234
Unless she's a good sport, then it's
like Saturday morning at the bakery.

314
00:20:14,568 --> 00:20:16,320
It's a complicated code.

315
00:20:17,571 --> 00:20:18,697
Don't worry about it.

316
00:20:18,864 --> 00:20:21,033
Bottom line is,
I'm out of the Mia business.

317
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:22,326
Cool.

318
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,745
Now, go to sleep.

319
00:20:26,372 --> 00:20:28,332
- Uncle Charlie?
- Yeah?

320
00:20:28,874 --> 00:20:31,377
I'm sorry I called you an ass-face.

321
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,672
Oh, yeah.

322
00:20:35,256 --> 00:20:36,298
I forgot about that.

323
00:21:16,922 --> 00:21:18,591
No woman is worth this.

324
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,679
I am so proud.

325
00:21:23,846 --> 00:21:26,223
Our little boy is growing up.

326
00:21:50,372 --> 00:21:52,458
