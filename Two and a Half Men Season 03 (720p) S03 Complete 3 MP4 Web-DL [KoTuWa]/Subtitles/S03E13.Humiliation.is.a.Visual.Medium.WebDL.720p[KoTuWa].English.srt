2
00:00:06,564 --> 00:00:08,941
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

3
00:00:09,108 --> 00:00:11,235
We said
we were gonna take things slow.

4
00:00:11,402 --> 00:00:14,739
We did say that.
I guess we can't be trusted.

5
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:19,076
- Charlie, talk to me.
- All right.

6
00:00:19,243 --> 00:00:22,371
You know what I'm gonna do to you,
you dirty, filthy girl?

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,585
- No, not like that.
- Wrong way? Am I a dirty, filthy boy?

8
00:00:28,085 --> 00:00:30,338
No, I wanna talk about us.

9
00:00:30,504 --> 00:00:32,965
We're a dirty, filthy couple.

10
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:36,427
No,
I wanna talk about our relationship.

11
00:00:37,511 --> 00:00:40,306
Well, that redirects the old blood flow.

12
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:45,936
Okay, so what about it?

13
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:50,358
- You know that I really care about you.
- And I care about you too.

14
00:00:50,524 --> 00:00:51,776
All right, good talk.

15
00:00:51,942 --> 00:00:54,236
I just wanna make sure
that if we do this...

16
00:00:54,403 --> 00:00:56,447
...we're doing it for the right reasons.

17
00:00:56,614 --> 00:01:00,743
Well, not to be contrary, but the wrong
reasons kick everything up a notch.

18
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:02,828
I just wanna make sure...

19
00:01:02,995 --> 00:01:05,164
...we give our relationship
a chance to grow.

20
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:08,626
- So you want to stop?
- No, I really want you.

21
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,758
Mia, all this starting and stopping
is really not good for my transmission.

22
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:19,845
I'm sorry. I'm just so confused. I...

23
00:01:20,012 --> 00:01:23,182
That's why you're gonna have to
make this decision for both of us.

24
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:26,018
Me? I have to make this decision?

25
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:29,313
That's like asking the fat kid
to guard the pie.

26
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,273
I trust you, Charlie.

27
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:33,692
Well, that is really low.

28
00:01:35,027 --> 00:01:38,614
- Okay, we'll wait.
- Thank you.

29
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:41,909
- So, what do we do now?
- We could take a walk on the beach.

30
00:01:42,076 --> 00:01:43,410
No, seriously.

31
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:49,333
Oh, yeah. Walk on the beach. Great.

32
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:52,336
I've always been meaning to do that.

33
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:01,845
Good morning, everyone.

34
00:02:02,012 --> 00:02:04,556
- Good morning.
- Looks to be a beautiful day.

35
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,851
Overcast, but that should burn off
in a few hours...

36
00:02:08,018 --> 00:02:10,812
...leaving us
with a sun-dappled afternoon in paradise.

37
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,775
You still drunk from last night
or did you get a fresh buzz this morning?

38
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:17,736
No, ma'am,
I am quite simply high on life.

39
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,573
Blotto.

40
00:02:22,115 --> 00:02:25,619
I am not drunk.
Alan, guess what I did last night.

41
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:28,246
- Jake.
- I'm leaving.

42
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:30,082
No, Jake can hear this.

43
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:32,334
- Last night...
- Wait, wait. Hang on, Charlie.

44
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:35,629
You're about to tell us something
that made you happy?

45
00:02:35,796 --> 00:02:36,922
- Yes.
- Jake.

46
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:38,131
I'm leaving.

47
00:02:38,298 --> 00:02:41,593
Jake, stay. I want to share this
with my entire family.

48
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,886
Okay, I'm leaving.

49
00:02:43,053 --> 00:02:45,222
Berta,
I consider you part of my family.

50
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,725
- Am I in your will?
- No, but neither are the rest of them.

51
00:02:51,228 --> 00:02:52,604
Now listen.

52
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:56,441
Last night, I, Charlie Harper,
delayed gratification.

53
00:02:57,067 --> 00:03:00,028
What did you do,
wait till she fell asleep?

54
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:04,991
- Wait for what?
- Jake.

55
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:06,868
- I'm leaving.
- Sit down.

56
00:03:07,869 --> 00:03:11,957
What happened last night is I may
have started a meaningful relationship.

57
00:03:12,124 --> 00:03:16,461
Charlie, seriously, go sleep it off.
You're embarrassing yourself.

58
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,756
Come on, listen to me.

59
00:03:19,923 --> 00:03:22,843
- I think I might be in love with Mia.
- Big deal.

60
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:25,345
You've always been in love
with you-a.

61
00:03:26,721 --> 00:03:29,099
- Very funny.
- I thought so. Did you think so?

62
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:30,976
- That was pretty good.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:31,142 --> 00:03:34,396
He's 11. He still thinks
"Milk Milk Lemonade" is funny.

64
00:03:34,563 --> 00:03:36,398
Oh, yeah.

65
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:39,317
Hello? Grandmommy's here.

66
00:03:39,484 --> 00:03:41,862
Oh, great.
Tell Mom what you told us, Charlie.

67
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:43,071
No.

68
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:45,156
- Tell me what?
- Nothing.

69
00:03:45,323 --> 00:03:47,200
- Do you need a good lawyer?
- No.

70
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:48,910
- Discreet doctor?
- No.

71
00:03:49,077 --> 00:03:51,079
- Knock-off Gucci handbag?
- What?

72
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:53,665
There's only so many ways
I can help you, dear.

73
00:03:56,084 --> 00:04:00,171
It's no big deal. I've just been seeing
this ballet dancer. She might be the one.

74
00:04:01,381 --> 00:04:02,883
Drunk?

75
00:04:04,092 --> 00:04:05,135
He says, "No."

76
00:04:05,302 --> 00:04:07,721
I think it might be
one of those designer drugs.

77
00:04:07,888 --> 00:04:11,516
Charlie, what did you take?

78
00:04:13,226 --> 00:04:16,187
I'm serious. We've been
seeing each other for over a month.

79
00:04:16,354 --> 00:04:20,108
We're waiting to sleep together until
our relationship has a solid foundation.

80
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:24,154
Well, we can rule out ecstasy.
I mean, that's a powerful aphrodisiac.

81
00:04:26,072 --> 00:04:27,324
I've heard.

82
00:04:28,783 --> 00:04:32,787
Nowadays you're supposed to say
"African American-disiac."

83
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:36,625
- Jake.
- You sure this time?

84
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,461
- Yeah.
- I'm leaving.

85
00:04:39,628 --> 00:04:42,547
Has it occurred to you
that maybe I've finally matured?

86
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:45,133
Maybe I'm ready to build something
with a woman...

87
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,135
...that isn't solely based on sex?

88
00:04:47,302 --> 00:04:48,803
- Has that occurred to you?
- No.

89
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,388
Berta?

90
00:04:50,555 --> 00:04:51,890
So it's not just me.

91
00:04:52,057 --> 00:04:54,517
You know,
I can understand your skepticism.

92
00:04:54,684 --> 00:04:57,854
I've earned it.
But this girl is different.

93
00:04:58,021 --> 00:05:00,231
And I'm gonna make it work.

94
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:05,070
I give him another week before he's out
on the beach, humping wet sand.

95
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:03,002
- Hey.
- Hey.

96
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:04,629
How was your date?

97
00:06:10,385 --> 00:06:11,845
Fun.

98
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:14,681
We went bowling.

99
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:16,808
Still playing it slow?

100
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:21,146
Ketchup slow.

101
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,983
Glacier slow.

102
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:29,320
Continental drift slow.

103
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:32,949
- So slow?
- I'm saying.

104
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:34,659
Hey, listen.

105
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:39,330
About this living without sex thing. I was
hoping you can give me a little advice.

106
00:06:39,497 --> 00:06:42,834
Me?
What would make you think of me?

107
00:06:43,668 --> 00:06:47,505
Well, I figure you get laid less often
than a boil-covered dwarf, am I right?

108
00:06:48,673 --> 00:06:51,843
I don't have the actual statistics,
but go on.

109
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,804
Well, you must get really frustrated.

110
00:06:55,346 --> 00:06:57,724
I mean, how do you stop yourself from,
you know...

111
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:01,269
...running a red light and then
taunting the cop till he shoots you?

112
00:07:01,436 --> 00:07:02,770
Good question.

113
00:07:02,937 --> 00:07:06,357
I've found that the best thing to do
is to focus on your career...

114
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:10,028
...get a hobby, become involved
in community activities...

115
00:07:10,194 --> 00:07:13,072
...and at the end of the day,
if you have any energy left...

116
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:14,407
...find a quiet space...

117
00:07:14,574 --> 00:07:16,993
...and yank it like a monkey
in a mango tree.

118
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:21,331
Interesting.

119
00:07:21,497 --> 00:07:23,499
What kind of hobbies
are we talking about?

120
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,046
Well, I tried collecting stamps,
building model trains...

121
00:07:28,212 --> 00:07:31,883
...but in the end,
all roads led back up the mango tree.

122
00:07:34,135 --> 00:07:36,554
That's what I was afraid of.

123
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:40,058
Hey, where are you going?

124
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:43,269
I'm gonna go get in my car...

125
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:46,981
...run a red light
and hope for a clean headshot.

126
00:07:52,654 --> 00:07:55,990
The great thing about this piece
is that it fuses a classical score...

127
00:07:56,157 --> 00:07:58,576
...with jazz choreography.

128
00:08:02,455 --> 00:08:05,792
On a counter programming note,
the Lakers are playing Miami tonight.

129
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,587
- Would you rather watch that?
- No, no, this is fine.

130
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:12,840
Of course, I don't have a $500 bet
down on the ballet.

131
00:08:15,176 --> 00:08:19,555
- What channel?
- No, seriously, this is... Channel 2.

132
00:08:21,724 --> 00:08:26,312
Charlie, you don't have to give up
things that you like just because of me.

133
00:08:33,403 --> 00:08:36,572
Oh, okay, great. Good to know.

134
00:08:37,073 --> 00:08:40,701
Hey,
as long as we're on that subject...

135
00:08:45,456 --> 00:08:47,458
...there's something
I wanna run past you.

136
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,044
- Go ahead.
- Let me just preface it by saying...

137
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:52,004
...that I am for holding off
on sex...

138
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:56,426
...so our relationship can develop more,
you know, deepness.

139
00:08:56,592 --> 00:08:58,302
I'm glad. I think it's working too.

140
00:08:58,469 --> 00:09:02,098
We were getting closer than we would,
had we just jumped into bed together.

141
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:04,934
Good.
Sounds like we're on the same page.

142
00:09:05,393 --> 00:09:07,687
And just to make sure
we don't jump the gun...

143
00:09:07,854 --> 00:09:09,814
...I was thinking it'd be a good idea...

144
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:14,777
...if I had an outlet that,
you know, took the pressure off.

145
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:17,697
- An outlet?
- Yeah, an outlet.

146
00:09:17,864 --> 00:09:20,032
Something casual, meaningless.

147
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:23,119
If I work it right,
it could even be anonymous.

148
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:29,750
- You mean another woman?
- Well, that would be my first choice.

149
00:09:32,211 --> 00:09:35,923
But for the purposes of this discussion,
let's stay with the term, "Outlet."

150
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,550
I don't care what you call it.

151
00:09:37,717 --> 00:09:40,678
You're asking for permission
to have sex with another woman.

152
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:45,141
Only because I care about you too much
to whore around without permission.

153
00:09:45,308 --> 00:09:47,351
Are you crazy?

154
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:50,021
I can't go back to the mango tree,
Mia.

155
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:51,898
What?

156
00:09:52,064 --> 00:09:56,652
Look, I think this is a mature,
thoughtful suggestion.

157
00:09:56,819 --> 00:10:00,990
In fact, there are many cultures
that embrace the whole outlet concept...

158
00:10:01,157 --> 00:10:03,451
...as a way of strengthening
and nurturing...

159
00:10:03,618 --> 00:10:05,828
...the primary love relationship.

160
00:10:08,664 --> 00:10:12,710
- You can't dismiss entire cultures with:
- I'm going home.

161
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:15,838
Oh, come on, we're just talking here.

162
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:20,760
I propose an idea, then we compromise.
That's the cornerstone of a relationship.

163
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:22,303
How are we gonna compromise?

164
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,764
Are you gonna have sex
with half a woman?

165
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:26,849
Is that an option?

166
00:10:31,812 --> 00:10:33,648
What's going on?

167
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,317
- We had our first fight.
- Oh, what about?

168
00:10:36,484 --> 00:10:39,070
I suggested
that as long as we weren't having sex...

169
00:10:39,236 --> 00:10:42,990
...it'd be good for our relationship
if I had sex with somebody else.

170
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:46,744
And she didn't buy that?

171
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,829
Wouldn't even discuss it.

172
00:10:50,247 --> 00:10:51,832
Women, huh?

173
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:56,879
They say they wanna talk,
but they don't wanna talk.

174
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:03,927
What's the matter with Uncle Charlie?

175
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:06,722
He's down because he had a fight
with his girlfriend.

176
00:11:07,306 --> 00:11:09,808
- That's too bad.
- Hey, why don't you go talk to him.

177
00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:11,810
- Maybe you can cheer him up.
- How?

178
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:13,729
I don't know. Tell him a joke.

179
00:11:14,146 --> 00:11:15,689
Okay.

180
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:20,652
Might as well just give him
a bowl of Milky Ways.

181
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:24,198
Hey, Uncle Charlie,
what's green, has four legs...

182
00:11:24,364 --> 00:11:28,076
...and would kill you
if it fell out of a tree and landed on you?

183
00:11:28,744 --> 00:11:30,787
- What?
- A pool table.

184
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:35,876
It's funny because
you wouldn't expect it to be in a tree.

185
00:11:40,297 --> 00:11:41,882
Nothing.

186
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,594
Okay, I'll talk to him.

187
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:48,972
Hey, if you can work up a fart,
ask him to pull your finger.

188
00:11:53,685 --> 00:11:56,104
- Hey.
- Hey.

189
00:11:57,981 --> 00:12:02,569
- Still haven't heard from Mia?
- She won't return my calls.

190
00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:07,616
You do realize that suggesting
to have sex with other women...

191
00:12:07,783 --> 00:12:10,327
...was a monumentally stupid thing
to do.

192
00:12:11,787 --> 00:12:13,830
Yes, Alan, I realize it.

193
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:20,212
The question now,
is how do I apologize?

194
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:22,464
You mean grovel.

195
00:12:22,714 --> 00:12:27,302
No, I mean apologize
with my dignity and pride intact.

196
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:32,265
Oh, you sad, naive fool.

197
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:35,435
If marriage taught me anything...

198
00:12:35,602 --> 00:12:38,522
...it's that there is no apologizing
without groveling.

199
00:12:39,189 --> 00:12:42,442
- Mia and I aren't married.
- Are you having sex?

200
00:12:43,402 --> 00:12:44,986
Continue.

201
00:12:45,153 --> 00:12:46,905
First of all, the phone's no good.

202
00:12:47,072 --> 00:12:50,909
You must grovel in person.
Humiliation is a visual medium.

203
00:12:51,076 --> 00:12:53,286
- Okay.
- Next, don't go empty-handed.

204
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:57,624
But keep in mind that any gifts you offer
may end up being thrown at your head.

205
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:01,253
Flowers, lingerie, jewelry, all good.

206
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,298
Picture frames, waffle irons,
steak knives, not so much.

207
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:08,218
You actually bought your wife
a waffle iron?

208
00:13:08,385 --> 00:13:09,803
I was young.

209
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,097
She liked waffles.

210
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:16,768
Anyway,
the most important thing is sincerity.

211
00:13:16,935 --> 00:13:18,437
- Sincerity?
- Yes.

212
00:13:18,603 --> 00:13:21,565
You absolutely must be able
to fake sincerity.

213
00:13:21,732 --> 00:13:23,650
You know what?
I've underestimated you.

214
00:13:23,817 --> 00:13:26,987
You are far more deceitful
than I've given you credit for.

215
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:30,532
- Thank you.
- No, I was faking sincerity.

216
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:32,868
Oh, it's very good.

217
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:35,787
But all kidding aside,
I really appreciate your help.

218
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:38,748
- Well, you're welcome.
- Got you again.

219
00:13:38,915 --> 00:13:40,542
That's... That was good.

220
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:43,211
- Oh, hey, can you do me a favor?
- What's that?

221
00:13:43,378 --> 00:13:45,130
Pull my finger.

222
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:47,507
- You're bluffing.
- Try me?

223
00:13:51,261 --> 00:13:53,555
Wait, give me another chance.

224
00:13:53,722 --> 00:13:55,307
I though I had one.

225
00:14:07,152 --> 00:14:09,529
- Hi.
- Hi.

226
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:12,574
- These are for you.
- You didn't have to do that.

227
00:14:12,741 --> 00:14:15,243
Really? My brother said I did.

228
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:17,954
Well, thank him for me.

229
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,123
Come on in.

230
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,501
I just want you to know
how sorry I am.

231
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:25,170
Actually, I think I owe you an apology.

232
00:14:25,337 --> 00:14:28,215
- You do?
- Yeah, these are for you.

233
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:30,800
You didn't have to do that.

234
00:14:31,676 --> 00:14:33,678
I shouldn't have gotten so angry
with you.

235
00:14:33,845 --> 00:14:37,766
Not to say that your "outlet" idea wasn't
incredibly juvenile, selfish, moronic...

236
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:39,935
I accept your apology.

237
00:14:41,686 --> 00:14:44,397
The point is,
is that I really don't have any right...

238
00:14:44,564 --> 00:14:46,733
...to object to you
sleeping with other women.

239
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,527
We don't have a commitment.
You're free to do whatever.

240
00:14:49,986 --> 00:14:53,573
Thanks. That's great. Very mature.

241
00:14:53,823 --> 00:14:55,951
- So everything's okay now?
- No, you ass.

242
00:14:58,703 --> 00:15:01,289
If we keep seeing each other,
I want a commitment.

243
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:03,250
- Commitment?
- Yes, a commitment.

244
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,918
Does that mean we can have sex?

245
00:15:05,085 --> 00:15:08,088
Is that the only reason
you'd be willing to make a commitment?

246
00:15:08,338 --> 00:15:10,465
It's in the top two.

247
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:14,803
Well, I think sex should wait
until we get our relationship on track.

248
00:15:15,762 --> 00:15:18,473
Okay, okay.
Let me make sure I understand this.

249
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,143
You want me to make a commitment
that I will not have sex with anyone...

250
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,646
...at the same time
I'm not having sex with you?

251
00:15:24,813 --> 00:15:26,314
Yes.

252
00:15:27,816 --> 00:15:30,360
All right,
let's come at this from another angle.

253
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:36,825
We're gonna be sexually exclusive,
but without the sex?

254
00:15:36,992 --> 00:15:39,369
Well,
I suppose you could look at it that way.

255
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:48,461
So bottom line...

256
00:15:50,922 --> 00:15:53,717
...no sex for Charlie...

257
00:15:55,468 --> 00:15:58,054
...with you or anyone else
for the foreseeable future.

258
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:00,056
Correct.

259
00:16:02,183 --> 00:16:03,977
Are you insane?

260
00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:07,522
If you care about us, it should be
something that you wanna do.

261
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:09,441
What are you giving up?

262
00:16:09,607 --> 00:16:11,985
- The same thing.
- You wanna sleep with other guys?

263
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:14,696
- Of course not.
- Then you're giving up nothing.

264
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:20,994
Tell you what, I'll give up sex.
You give up, I don't know, a kidney.

265
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:23,705
Come on, don't be stupid.

266
00:16:23,872 --> 00:16:27,417
- Okay, okay, dancing.
- Dancing's my life, Charlie.

267
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:30,044
Now we have a level playing field.

268
00:16:31,045 --> 00:16:33,089
You know what,
maybe you should just go.

269
00:16:33,256 --> 00:16:36,676
Right, why stay here when I can
just as easily not have sex with you...

270
00:16:36,843 --> 00:16:38,344
...in the comfort of my home?

271
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:39,763
Oh, go to hell.

272
00:16:43,683 --> 00:16:47,061
See?
That's why you didn't get a waffle iron.

273
00:16:54,736 --> 00:16:56,237
Hey, how did it go with Mia?

274
00:16:56,404 --> 00:16:59,157
- Great. We broke up.
- How is that great?

275
00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:01,367
Now I can go back
to being who I really am.

276
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,077
And who's that?

277
00:17:03,244 --> 00:17:05,747
Somebody who doesn't care
who he really is.

278
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:07,540
Someone who just has fun.

279
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:10,627
I see. Someone who spends his life
in a drunken haze...

280
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:13,004
...having meaningless sex
with strangers.

281
00:17:13,171 --> 00:17:15,590
If you knew who I am,
why'd you ask?

282
00:17:16,925 --> 00:17:20,470
Hurry, Charlie.
I'm starting to sober up.

283
00:17:21,304 --> 00:17:23,139
Well, we can't have that.

284
00:17:24,015 --> 00:17:27,810
No. You might find out who she is.

285
00:17:31,064 --> 00:17:33,233
- Here you go.
- Good.

286
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:38,488
Boy, I haven't been this drunk
since I took my SATs.

287
00:17:39,197 --> 00:17:40,865
Doesn't seem to have held you back.

288
00:17:41,032 --> 00:17:44,827
No, just one year. Sixth grade.

289
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:51,834
Charlie? You okay?

290
00:17:52,001 --> 00:17:54,754
Yeah, I just got a lot on my mind.

291
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,049
Do you wanna look at my boobs?

292
00:18:00,218 --> 00:18:02,512
- No, thanks.
- Are you sure?

293
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:05,098
It always cheers me up.

294
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:12,146
Oh, Mia. Hi.

295
00:18:12,313 --> 00:18:14,148
Is Charlie here?

296
00:18:14,315 --> 00:18:17,277
- Tickle, tickle.
- Cut it out.

297
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:26,619
That was great, do it again.

298
00:18:29,414 --> 00:18:31,082
Alan,
don't you think it's time...

299
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:33,167
...you kept your girlfriend company?

300
00:18:33,334 --> 00:18:36,337
- My what?
- Thanks for playing along.

301
00:18:36,504 --> 00:18:42,427
Oh, yes, my... My girlfriend.
Yes, excuse me. Coming, pookie.

302
00:18:45,805 --> 00:18:49,809
- Well, this is an awkward moment.
- You are such a schmuck.

303
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:52,770
Okay, the ice is broken.

304
00:18:52,937 --> 00:18:54,439
- Goodbye, Charlie.
- Oh, come on.

305
00:18:54,605 --> 00:18:57,525
We don't have a commitment.
We don't have a relationship.

306
00:18:57,692 --> 00:18:59,861
You know, you're right.
Go back to your bimbo.

307
00:19:00,028 --> 00:19:02,155
Hey, hey, hey. She's not a bimbo.

308
00:19:07,702 --> 00:19:10,204
I'm not saying she's a brain surgeon.

309
00:19:10,371 --> 00:19:13,041
No, wait, Mia.
At least tell me why you came.

310
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,669
You wanna know why?
I came because after I cooled down...

311
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:19,464
...I started to miss you
and I wanted to make love.

312
00:19:19,964 --> 00:19:22,759
- That's great. It's wonderful.
- And it's not gonna happen.

313
00:19:23,301 --> 00:19:24,969
Why? Because of that bimbo?

314
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:27,847
Let me tell you something.

315
00:19:28,347 --> 00:19:32,351
The entire time I was fooling around
with her, I was thinking of you.

316
00:19:32,518 --> 00:19:34,520
Oh, swell.

317
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:36,105
You know what I mean.

318
00:19:36,272 --> 00:19:39,108
I would trade a hundred of her
for one of you.

319
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:41,402
You're ready to make a commitment?

320
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:43,112
Yes.

321
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:45,782
Maybe you want some time
to think about it?

322
00:19:45,948 --> 00:19:48,034
How could that help?

323
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:50,912
Look, I don't wanna be
with anybody but you...

324
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:53,164
...so I might as well be committed.

325
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:55,541
Yes, you should.

326
00:19:59,629 --> 00:20:03,216
- You wanna go upstairs?
- Not right now.

327
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:06,427
Oh, please don't tell me
you've got somebody in your room.

328
00:20:06,594 --> 00:20:09,305
No, no, no.

329
00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:11,015
No.

330
00:20:11,974 --> 00:20:14,018
If we're gonna
do this commitment thing...

331
00:20:14,185 --> 00:20:17,271
...the first time
should be really special.

332
00:20:17,605 --> 00:20:18,856
What have you got in mind?

333
00:20:19,023 --> 00:20:21,067
Well, you know. Candles, music...

334
00:20:21,234 --> 00:20:24,320
...and maybe not having the girl
I was trying to rebound with...

335
00:20:24,487 --> 00:20:27,281
...dancing half naked on the deck
with my idiot brother.

336
00:20:27,782 --> 00:20:30,451
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah. He's an idiot.

337
00:20:31,953 --> 00:20:33,996
Call me later.

338
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,256
Well, back to the mango tree.

339
00:20:54,225 --> 00:20:55,476
What is this?

340
00:20:55,643 --> 00:20:57,895
A healthy cereal
that won't rot your teeth.

341
00:20:58,062 --> 00:21:00,439
You got that right,
because I'm not eating it.

342
00:21:01,274 --> 00:21:02,608
That's all you're getting.

343
00:21:03,692 --> 00:21:04,985
- Morning.
- Morning.

344
00:21:05,152 --> 00:21:07,279
- Morning.
- Ls he in a better mood today?

345
00:21:07,488 --> 00:21:08,906
Yeah.

346
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:12,326
Uncle Charlie,
I got another joke for you.

347
00:21:16,455 --> 00:21:18,081
- Okay.
- There's two muffins...

348
00:21:18,248 --> 00:21:20,876
...sitting side by side
in a muffin tin in the oven.

349
00:21:21,043 --> 00:21:23,462
One muffin says,
"Boy, it's hot in here."

350
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:27,049
And the other one says,
"Holy crap, a talking muffin."

351
00:21:30,636 --> 00:21:34,264
I just don't think
he knows what's funny.

352
00:21:57,955 --> 00:22:00,040
